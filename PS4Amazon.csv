   Was said to be in “very good” condition. Product arrived, I plugged it into my tv, and the console started making noises as soon as I turned it on. I inserted many game discs and none of them would read, another problem was the software itself. I tried updating the console to the latest firmware, but it kept giving me an error message. I tried both methods (via Internet and USB) but none worked. Better off buying a PS4 slim. I gave it 3 stars because the seller was nice about giving me my refund.

  This was my first console I've purchased for myself. The product was used but labelled as very good and sold by Amazon.com Services, Inc. Unfortunately the controller only worked when close to the console. The controller had to be within a feet from the console for it to work and even then the connection sometime drops out. Using the USB cable was out of the question as the only method of connection is via bluetooth. Initially I thought that the controller was the issue so I went out and bought a new controller but still the issue persisted meaning the console was defective. Either the device got damaged during delivery or they did not properly test the console. The device is still usable but no to its fullest potential. This was a disappointing and expensive purchase and brings caution towards the labeling of used products that are sold by Amazon.

  i still remember that day October 15,2013. I went to a local Best Buy in line with literally 200 people in NYC. After 3 long hours(sorry no more ps4s). Went home so disappointed but quickly came on amazon. Amazingly that green light said ""in stock"" literally saved my entire night. Came with 2 day free shipping and was at my door. It was at that very day that amazon has become my go to place for shopping pretty much anything.It's now March 2018 and after owning this launch PS4, a Sony 4K tv with a PS4 pro and a PS4 slim for my bedroom along with over 100 games....I still think this is the most beautifully designed PS4 there is of all models despite it not having 4k. It's glossy finish, it's side light bar, it's loud fan during big games and beautiful edges make it sexy.

  I bought this system after purchasing and returning 3 different PS4 Slims and one PS4 Pro. None of the newer models would play two of my used games that has very light scratches on the discs. The discs run fine on this older model. I have had no issues with this system.Either there was a bad batch in my area or the newer systems are just not made to run discs with any blemish (conspiracy?!). So I'm very happy with this purchase.

  I warily bought this product open box for a steep discount, and I could not be more ecstatic! I play a LOT of video games, and this system is everything I'd hoped. Powerful, sleek, runs quietly, functions perfectly - I am a very happy consumer. I do everything from playing The Witcher and COD to streaming Netflix and HBO to shopping on PSN, and this system is stellar across the board.Bottom line: I thought ""How can it be any better than the PS3? As a broke post-grad, should I really invest so much money?"" And the answer is a resounding YES - If you love PS3, this system will seem spectacular and is absolutely worth the money.

  My PS3 only lasted about a year, so I was a little hesitant how long this unit would last.  I've had this for over a year and a half with no problems and I have got a lot of hours of use out of it.  The brand has been able to keep up with new and changing innovation and it has swayed me from my former brand loyalty.  You don't even need to be a gamer to get use out of this machine.  It will play blu-ray and dvd, and you can use it for streaming apps.  I really like that because I don't have to switch out a bunch of devices between limited HDMI ports on my TV.  I've also used it with my projector.

  Just a quick review since everyone else has said what needs to be said.Pros:-Fastest console on the market. Don't be fooled by the other guys. GDDR3 vs GDDR5 memory is no competition. GDDR3 is something modern mid-line PCs don't even use anymore.-Nice looking system. Really looks amazing in person.-PS+, while i don't like it being required to play my games online, is an amazing service and only adds to it's quality with the addition of the PS3/Vita. So much free. So many discounts.-Twitch.tv and Ustream services are easily accessed at a click of a button. Screen shots and video uploads (currently, only to Facebook).-Quiet. Nice and quiet. Killzone cranked up a fan a few times but it was still quiet.Cons:-Controller has a chance of being a dud. At least originally. I have 2 controllers and one of mine sticks all the time. Several forums on the internet have information on this. Sony will replace a busted controller though.-Controller light bar. It's bright. And there's no option to turn it off without modding your controller.-UI is bare right now. No themes. Just blue screen.-Missing a media player and DNLA support. This should be patched back in via firmware.-Included mic sucks. Buy a real mic.

  Very nervous about purchasing such an expensive gaming console from a third party site, however they kept true to their word about their product and I've yet to put it down. I went from the Playstation 3 to the new Playstation 4 only recently (late, yes I know, haven't had much time for gaming.) and yet with all the new features and expansive assortment of options available, the difference is day and night.What truly separates the ps4 from the competitors (I'm looking at you xbox 1) is the sheer amount of upgrades and performance enhancers built into this console. Playstation truly too it to the next level with this piece of engineering from the software to the cosmetics. Sleek, simple and yet elegant in its own way. I could go on for days about the technicality of it but I'll just leave y'all with this: Bar none the PS4 beats out any other gaming console to date, and I highly recommend it. So go ahead, enjoy.The only discrepancy I have about the PS4 online capabilities is the fact that going from free to play online to now having to pay $50 a year for the playstation plus subscription, is a little absurd, one of the elements of why I favored the ps3 to xbox 360, but oh well. It is well worth it in the amount of things you get back from your payment; including 2 free games every month!!

  I bought this model because it showed that is was a old discontinued model of the PS4. Which led me to believe it was an original model of the PS4, but that is not the case. The Playstation did not come with the original glossy side cover of the Playstation. It was matte black which honestly not the main issue. The issue is with the hard drive. The housing of the hard drive is not compatible with the original at all. The casing where hard drive is to be placed is upside down. The cradle where the hard drive is inserted does fit for the Playstation’s original hard drive. The Playstation screw is in the front and not the side where it should be. I am highly disappointed thinking the Playstation would be a replacement for my old one but I was completely wrong. Everything about the machine does not match up to the way it was originally created by Sony. I did not plug the system in because it does not have the capability for me to insert my Nyko modular attachment which hold my main hard drive of 4TB for my Playstation. I even have the pictures of a side by side comparison. I am so heartbroken about this product.

  Had this item since 2013, it's been well kept and dust free.  It now (2016) no longer boots, apparently the issue is common with all of these (blinking blue light).  I've read all the reviews online and there's no easy fix... Sony is charging minimum $99 repair free.  This should be reported with Consumer Affairs, no one should have to essentially re-purchase an electronic after only a few year usage!

  Admittedly I still don't have many games for this system yet other than freebie downloads off PSN. I do have Assassins Creed Black Flag for it though and the gameplay in itself for that takes some getting used to with the new controller ^_^;; The system is definitely an upgrade from the PS3. Speed, download time, functionality is all improved. Don't get me wrong I love the PS3 beyond belief. The PS4 is a perfect companion for it and for any fan of PlayStation. The buttons are very touch sensitive which is great because they're rather tiny on the console for appearance purposes.The controller is greatly more comfortable to handle than the previous Dualshock's, but trust me the touchpad takes some getting used to especially when the new games all have it integrated into gameplay in some form or another. Take your time making sure you know what it's used for.

  Received Christmas Eve and my niece has been playing it hours on end.She finished Knack in 3 sessions (short game) and is currently challenged with Assassins Creed (lots of cannonball fights at sea).The only negative, I've seen, is the reliability of the PSN plus network.  Seems to be down often for maintenance.  It was out of commission most of Christmas day and for an hour or so, a day or two afterwards.  Also, the game download discounts are non-existent.  I've only seen full price and the free games were not rotated on January 1.  Sony seems to be a bit greedy here, they should get people accustomed to buying games over the PSN store.

  The PS4 I purchased has operated perfectly so far.. The system is far superior to the previous ps3 system. it is a lot faster, and so much easier to use.. i also like how you can use multiple things at once and easily access them via the center PS button on the controller- i like being able to play music unlimited as I am playing games or doing other things.. I'm just waiting until they sell enough systems so there is financial incentive for game developers to put all their talents into PS4/xbox1 games..right now there are 100 million ps3/xbox systems and maybe 10 percent of that # of the new systems.. so they obviously won't sell as many games on the new systems. maybe in a year or 2 we will start seeing amazing games. only new game i want to see is watchdogs, which, to be honest, looks like grand theft auto with hacking

  I'd love to say that the graphics are fantastic and that the speaker on the controller can provide immesion with in certain games. The console design is sleek and smaller. As well as it looks amazing. The controller responds great and feels confortable.However I feel that this console has a huge lack of titles and its potential is completely under done. I though that it had the ability to play old gen titles, and just dissapointed me there as well. No it will not run any ps1 games and no you cannot purchase any on the store. You can stream certain games however you need a subscription which is completely different from the online subscription you already pay for if you choose to. The blueray support and cd support was indeed patched in last second. Aside from these issues it's still fun to use!A good console!

  I searched high and low for a ps4 but could not locate one.  Amazon emailed me that they had a small number in and to order directly from Amazon Prime.  A few days later I had the console.The graphics are amazing, And the interface is clean.  And controller is wireless and can be charged by the console itself.  It also doubles as a Blu-Ray player, web browser, and you can directly stream videos as well as play games.  Sony has a site to download games, or you can order the discs.  There is also a vast online community to share accomplishments.If you are a serious gamer this is the console to get.

  First off I want to state that Amazon has really gone the extra mile.  I ordered my PS4 with free shipping (8-11 days I believe) on 12/20 and received it 12/23.  Very fast and efficient service!As for the PS4, I set it up and it started right away.  I was afraid I would get a lemon but so far I am having no problems.  The console itself is tiny!  I have it next to my 80GB PS3 and it is less then half the size.  Sony has their work cutout for them if they decide to make a slim version in a few years.  I got an extra controller and the Playstation Camera along with it and am having fun using the Playroom but it seems like it would get boring very fast.  I'm hoping they come out with more games that use the camera but since its only been out for over a month I get it is limited.  The controller feels amazing! No joke, this controller feels like it was custom made for my hands.  A huge upgrade from the PS3 controller that felt like it could break in my hands at any moment.  I'm spending time now playing Resogun and Blacklight Retribution and waiting for games like Infamous Second Son and Watch Dogs to come out.The only negative I found on this console (and the reason why I'm rating it 4 stars instead of 5) is because I can't play my PS3 games.  If and when Sony releases a fix to this through that Gaikai streaming service and I see that it works sufficiently I will change my rating to 5 stars.

  The user interface takes a little bit of getting used to, but seems to be relatively simple and ad-free compared to that of the Xbox One. The ability to put apps (i.e. Netflix or Amazon Prime) on hold to open another app or navigate through the menus is great.The controller is great, though I do miss the ""start"" button. The touch pad works well in game play and doesn't feel gimmicky. The recent system update allowing users to dim the light bar on the controller has helped extend the decent battery life.I highly recommend purchasing with a PlaysStation Plus subscription, as the free games every month are a nice addition. The free games for the PlayStation 4 are nowhere near as good as the options that have been coming out for the PlayStation 3, however.

  The Ps4 is Awesome! I have both systems and they are worth it! Yes there is bitter reviews,  but really 1 star? Faulty products do happen so don't let that be the reason not to buy it. Amazon will take care of you if something like that was to occur. So now onto the product. This system definitely pushed the bar beyond what i thought next gen was going! The UI is fast and simple, and the setup is easy. Yes there is some minor faults like connecting surround sound. (need an optical cord) and doesn't use old TB headsets (as of now) and 3d support, But like i said those are minor.  Make sure you get playstation plus for the free games and to play online.Yes they have a online membership like xbox but the difference is $10 cheaper and they give free games with it or discounted.  Yes there is limited titles out right now but there will be a-lot of them coming! As for over paying for the system don't! Just get on the waiting list or get sent a reminder when they are available.

  This is one of my most favorite gaming council's I wish that the on line was still free but once you pay for it you get more to do on this council than you would on the peace theory but over all the smoothness of the operating system is so much mooted in the PS3

  I bought this for my husbands birthday. He was very excited for the specific purchase (the 500 gb hard drive).We watch all of our movies on here, so for me it's been excellent to have. We didn't have a blue ray player prior to owning this console, so it's been really nice to widen our movie collection now that we have the ps4.The order came quickly and I had zero complications.Highly recommend.

  Ive grown up on Playstation. System is great. can't wait two years from now once the game designers get some experience to the new system and are able to develop some truly amazing games.  The new UI takes a little getting used to. There is only 2 usb ports. No DLNA support (no streaming movies to the ps4 from your pc for viewing on your TV)The new controller design is nice, the ps4 system itself looks good. doesn't get too hot or too loud. solid console.  maybe once i get more ownership and wear and tear out of this and see what games are developed in the future, i might be willing to upgrade to 5 stars.

  I LOVE my PS4. The exclusives are great, and as of now the OS has been updated finally to use external hard drives and folder sorting of installed applications. My only serious complaint with the system is the lack of available USB ports. Once you steal one for an external hard drive, you only have one left. Definitely necessitates the need for a USB hub for the system.

  After having the system since launch I can confidently say that the Playstation 4 is a console worth owning.Sony is doing great in price, content, and functionality.The controller feel comfortable. Graphics are impressive. Playstation Plus is also a very good value. I get so many free games that I can't keep up with it!And of course it plays movies, streams content, and has all of your favorites ranging from hulu to Spotify.If you haven't bought a PS4 yet then go ahead and do it! Now is the perfect time to join in the fun

  I love the console but it has sound issues (No 5.1 surround sound when playing Blu ray movies or streaming services, only stereo)After trying everything and contacting Sony's support team, I got to the conclusion that the PS4 has huge software issues that must be patch really soon. Searching online you'll see all the Sound problems this console has.I returned my PS4 and I probably get another one when this issue get fixed. However, after 4 months from its released and 400$, you might expect something really different from a console that is supposed to be state of the art tech.

  The system has continued to do what all of Sony's game systems have done for me.  It hasn't broken down yet.  I have never recieved a messed up system from the start with these guys though I'm sure it happens.  Only issue I have is with the fact that the controllers don't last very long but I have since bought me a docking station for them to charge so thats been taken care of.  I like the feeling of how light the system is.  The controller is great as I am glad they added the weight to it.  The original ones for the PS3 just were too light and I have to many messed ones because of it.  The head phones are so-so but for a person that spends very little time communicating with others online it really doesn't matter to me.  Of course you have to have an updated TV with HDMI to use it but I bought mine the minute I got a PS3 so that was taken care of long ago.  Now just waiting on some better games as both systems (PS4 and Xbox ONE) are kind of lacking in that area.  I have time though as I work most of the time and use Netflix most of the week anyway.

  I know you have to expect issues when you buy a 'used' console, but reselling your garbage is another thing entirely.Quite simply, the console didn't work. On the rare occasions it actually managed to start up, I couldn't play more than 15-20 minutes before a blue ""haze"" covered the screen and the system became nonoperational. The only way to fix it was to pull the plug, which (of course) caused more data loss and subsequent crashes. I had to return it for a refund.That said, I will commend the company (JMS Holdings) on their excellent customer service. My request (and the actual refund) were processed very quickly, and I got the entirety of my money back. That matters, especially when you're dealing with a high-price item, and I appreciate it.

  The first games I bought for my PS4 were Lego Marvel & Battlefield 4 which were great to showcase what the system can do. Resogun is a free game you can play when you're a PS Plus member. I have been playing inFamous Second Son & the DualShock 4 controller couldn't have been any better for the game. The system can fix the friend list & the organization of the menu bars.It doesn't show PS3 players if you're online. The DS4 controller definitely dies fast, a full charge last me about 3 hrs, so buying two controllers is a must.Sony has definitely perfected the PS4, a few software enhancements can make the experience even better. I can't wait to see what the future of games can do with the power of PS4

  In response to so many reviews about defective units, I thought I'd just say that my PS4 is working fine so far. The only thing I've noticed is that the cooling fan is pretty noisy, but that's it. And it works fine even though the box it came it was unbelievably beat to heck by UPS, to the point the box was noticeably ripped open and taped shut again (Amazon's poor packaging didn't help things).As for the console itself, I see great potential. As with any launch, the games are pretty lacking- my PC would laugh at the new Killzone game, for example (30fps? Really?), but I can't wait to see the future PS4 exclusives coming down the line. Exclusives are going to be the main strength of the PS4 over the XboxOne, which Microsoft has always seemed to have trouble securing outside of Halo. I think if you're like me and have a PS4 and a gaming class PC, you're covered.

  I love this system.PROS for me:-Graphic are much more crisp and in tune with this generation-The overall layout is simple enough after a few times using the system-Great layout of things on it, easy to get from one place to another, and fast-Add-ons are awesome-PS plus is actually pretty cool, you get discounts and free games every month on various things-PS4 stepped it up big time compared to the PS3 launch.-Lots of fun free games out right now and next month more and more games begin to come out. As of right now it is Killzone, Order 1886, and BF4 for me.CONS for me:-no ability to name change-No backward compatibility which i hate because I love Skyrim and refuse to not play a few hours every when I can-The upgrades from PS3-PS4 do not transfer game saves which meant I had to start over for Assassin Creed Black Flag I hope everyone who wants one will get one and I hope they re-stock for everyone fast.

  Was Xbox owner last two generations, switched over to PS4 and could not be happier with my choice. PS4 does exactly what I want it to do, the opening screen menus are not as disjointed as the clustered Xbox one was. The controller feels very Next Gen ish and I love the fact that I don't need to hoard batteries anymore.Games play smoothly and the device barely makes any noise when running. Only thing that could potentially be a problem with the PS4 is the lack of hardware space. 500 GB sounds like a lot but it is 400GB of available space when you start it up and each game you buy (including game disks from retail outlets) REQUIRES a mandatory install onto your PS4 drive so it can run more efficiently. (The Installs are anywhere from 11GB to 40GB) SO far that is not a problem since not that many games out, but after a year or two, we as consumers will have to constantly be deleting our older games to fit in new ones.

  Full Disclaimer, own Xbox one: I have owned every single PlayStation Consoles, and this is by far the best Gaming console sony has made. The gaming graphic is superb; I  enjoy the high quality Sony provided us. The new DualShock controller fits great in one's hand, and it is very comfortable and the touchpad works all right, but I feel it revolting sometimes. I enjoy playing Madden 25, and Call of Duty: Ghosts. The graphic performance is exquisite, very fast with lack of noise, which makes gaming so enjoyable. Gamers no longer have to worry about consoles overheating due to gameplay. Some people are complaining about the hard drive sound; however, my current console does not experience that issue. The UI works great and is very fast and responsive. Something I enjoy using is DLNA, with multiple devices and it is a not sure why sony did not include it, maybe they will since its software related, but only time will tell. The 3.5mm jack works awesomely with most pair of headphones. The PlayStation Network is gradually improving, and I believe over time it will transcend pass the Xbox Gaming Network. An innovation Sony must capture if they want to become the number one gaming system, would be the integration of the PlayStation Vita's in the ecosystem, so its interacting as one collective unit. Downloanding using this current system works exceptional well. Sony PS4 is for gamers, and I am glad I purchased the day one edition. PS4 is a top notch gaming console and for sony. Another selling point for the PS4 is the dedicated gaming graphics, which will continue its evolving process til Full 1080p 60FPS multi gaming becomes a reality. Currently, most games are running on 720p 60 FPS, I believe there are one two games that are running on 1080p 60 FPS on single player, Killzone Shadow, which is very disappointing, case and point for the 4stars review. I am looking forward to  exciting Sony exclusive games titles that should be coming out in the coming months.

  Let me talk a little about the console.We've had ours since launch day because... we preordered one the day preorders were possible. Our expectations were high for the console build and features and realistic for the launch date games and both expectations were generally met. In other words, we are happy so far and we are happy to see that every firmware update gets us a slightly more capable gaming console and every month there are new good, sometimes great and every once in a while awesome games released, some multi-platform, some exclusive.So, without regurgitating published specs... let's talk about what you get out of a PS4THE AWESOME AND THE GOODHere they are, first briefly, then discussed below.- Awesome, flawless graphics. No, I am not comparing the PS4 to gaming PCs that cost 2-3-4 times as much. For what we pay, and comparing the PS4 to the previous generation of consoles, the graphics a quite  impressive. And it's not just resolution but the console's ability to keep track of a lot more independently moving objects without slowing down or dropping frames.- Near-revolutionary new DualShock 4 controller. Battery life is not that great (get a second if you can spare the extra cash) but I do appreciate the added in-controller speakers, the clickable touchpad and the way the slightly beefier controller feels.- When compared to the PS3, 10x the processing power, 32x more RAM and it shows.- Digital content is available at whatever PS4 you log into- HDD still upgradeable without voiding warranty - popped in a 1TB 7200 RPM upgrade and it was easy.- No power brick- Game and chat audio can be sent to a headset through PS4's 3.5mm port.- Many media apps: Netflix, Amazon, etc. and the list is constantly growing.- Online access is 100% optional. Yes, you can do it all, including system patches without ever connecting your PS4 to the Internet.- PS Plus subscription only required for (most) multiplayer games, not for media services.- PS Plus offers a couple of good 'free' games, some older AAAs, some new indies every month and you can play them for as long as you are subscribing.- Plenty of sharing, social featuresTHE  UGLY AND THE BADAnd... yeah, not everything is awesome and here it is what needs to be fixed or get better so that we all become a happy gaming family. This may seem to be a long list but I am confident that quite a few of the items below are going to be addressed sooner rather than later and nearly all of them before the end of 2014.- No Media Server/DLNA support and this is one of the few reasons our old PS3 is used almost as much as the PS4- No support for audio CDs (no big deal to most but still dumb)- No support for Bluetooth headsets (I bet they'll fix this soon)- No support for mice of any kind (Bluetooth or USB)- DS4's lightbar can't be turned off completely even though it can be dimmed a little- Doesn't play PS3 games except for the few available as streaming rentals and the price for that service is not 'right'.FIVE STARS IF THIS SUITS YOUThere are different bundles available so it's good to be able to pick the one that fits you best. Promos come and go so take advantage of one. I noticed that at the time I am writing this review you get one of 4 free games as a download which is nice.-->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! <<

  controller is better, definitely better graphically, that party system is nice, remote play is fantastic if you have a friend you want to show a game from across the country, but maybe less so if you live in the same city. but this far along still lacks some features of the ps3, and it's simple things like sort app's by favorites and connecting a wide variety of bluetooth head sets or completing install updates in power save mode. and lastly hdd is more limited than i would like. comes with a 500 gb hdd but 1 tb drives are cheap (only $20 more than what they come with or $30 more for a faster 1 TB hdd or $45 more 2 tb drive) and after saves, updates, dlc, and the video capture/share mode that you can't disable to free up those resources after 6-7 games you have to start making choices on what to save and what you want to reinstall next time you choose to play it. the standard hdd it comes with just isn't enough. i like it, but i wanted to like it more and the worst thing is i know exactly why.but really at the end of the day the most important thing is what your friends play, because that means at least as much as all this, so ask what they have and then get that too.

  I have had my PS4 for 2 months now and it is awesome.  The controller feels great, and has the much needed improvement over the past PS controllers.  The Seamless transition from game to main menu then either back or to a new app is great.  The updated Party features the are more like how the Xbox 360 is, makes this an almost flawless system.  Few things I don't like it getting to messages sent to me, or updates to what my friends are playing, It's hard to sort through and find the High score updates so I know what Im trying to beat them at.  Other then that I love this console!!  Add the PS app to your phone for wireless keyboard function and you have everything you need for a great gaming system!

  I like pretty much everything about it.Just a couple gripes: loud fan, especially in graphically tolling games like Uncharted 4.  The XMB (main menu) is sloppy and disorganized.  I hate scrolling through a million pictures to get to the one game or demo I want to play.The controller fells good.  Works well.  It dies pretty quickly, though.I feel like it was an unnecessary platform, honestly, with few games seeming like large graphical improvements upon the PS3.  I only bought it to play Uncharted 4, and I'll pick up a few more gems on the way until I get a gaming PC.

  As a big baseball fan, I wanted the the next-gen version of MLB 14 The Show which prompted me to buy a PS4. Now I can't wait for Sony to continue the tradition of bringing a slew of great exclusive titles to this thing, just like they did with the PS3 & PS2.To go along with my PS4, I purchased a 1.5 TB hard drive to swap with the 500 GB hard drive that is included with the console. The console and larger hard drive arrived on the same day, so before even turning the console on, I swapped hard drives, and I would like to give kudos to Sony for making this incredibly easy. Now that I have a much larger hard drive in my PS4, it will be my main console for the generation, and will be the console I purchase most, if not all multi-platform titles on.After having the console for a month and a half so far, I really enjoy it. The UI is great and easy to use, and the speed in switching from one game to another is a breeze.I find myself gaming on my PS4 much more than I do my Xbox One or my Wii U.

  still not much a fan of either Sony or the PS4 itself. however, i will say that mine is of the first model off of the line. and it is still running just fine. ( did replace the thermal paste after the warranty, though )i am just not a fan of the dashboard mostly. it is too clunky and doesn't seem very game oriented. and browsing ones own library is STILL a mess. the what's new screen just never seems to change. just a bunch of spam from yours and your friends activities, with no way to turn any of it off. therefore, Sony cannot deliver directly to their consumers good advertising. ( not sure why they don't fix this. just make a new tab for activity... right? )just a few tips for keeping your PS4 cool...1.) heat rises. so while not really practical, the lower in the room the cooler the PS4 can remain.2.) don't set it on its side. basically you will choke the intake amount of cool air. the little holes there on the side are your intake. when on its side, only a few holes towards the ends will be taking in cool air. if the holes on the other side were larger, it wouldn't be an issue, but then dust would be an issue. whether or not this chokes your intake may depend on your model, just look at it and you will know. maybe check for a stand to buy.3.) despite what is said above, keeping flat on a surface isn't entirely good either. it sits too close to your surface. this causes heat to accumulate in that surface. eventually the surface won't be able to disperse anymore heat, so it returns to the inside of the PS4 increasing ambient temperatures. just stick yourself a small stub in each corner to raise the system about a 1/2 inch from the surface.4.) if your warranty is already void, or don't care... upgrade the thermal paste. (if you don't know how, youtube ought to have sufficient information)

  Looks great , except the fact , that glossy finish is extremely easy to scratch or to leave marks. I wiped it with microfiber cleaning cloth that I use for my glasses and still lots of light scratches all over the surface. The controller's battery do not last as much , as the one in the PS3 controller. This console has a long way ahead , and I'm looking to see its progress  ! Can't wait for the next ""Naughty dog"", ""Santa Monica"" and ""Quantic Dream"" games ! TO unleash the graphic to its full potential , and to get a native 1080p  resolution with all details maxed to match the PS4 hardware performance ! I used to have both PS3 and XBOX 360 consoled , but sold them to get true 1080p on my 150"" projector screen. At this image size , resolution must be the highest one accepted by your hardware. I'll get XBOX one , but not until they get rid of the power brick and reduce the size and weight to the PS4 level ! However design the Microsoft next generation console , needs replacement ! External power supply, DDR3, old VHS design and footprint? Really ?

  I bought this as I wanted to play PS4 exclusives. I'm primarily a PC gamer but the PS4 I received was sleek and clean. Declutter Store was nice enough to also bundle the console with the wires and the controller. For the time I did have it, it ran like a gem. I never saw any issues with it. It was like having a new PS4 for the price of a used one.Unfortunately, I no longer have it as it was stolen and sold by a disowned family member I had a court order against (my father). Before I see comments, I went to the police twice. I'll never see this particular console again but it's getting replaced soon. Nonetheless, if you are thinking about getting one at the supposed end of the life cycle--- get it! Sony's game products makes it worth it. You'll have plenty to catch up on!

  I was really skeptical about purchasing the PS4 in November, and I'm guess I'm glad I waited until February. It looks like a decent amount of people had issues with their PS4's, and that's a shame. But, I guess time and lessons learned has paid off for Sony. The one that was shipped out to me has worked FLAWLESSLY. Here's a quick breakdown:PROS:- The new XMB OS is amazing and lightyears beyond the PS3 XMB.- Online play is more stable and faster than PS3. Looks like Sony can afford better servers now with PS+ :)- Graphics are out of this world. On par with PC graphics at this time.- Dualshock 4 is comfortable, easy to use, and the best the PlayStation has ever had. It's still not as good as the Xbox 360 controller, but it's only off by a hair. The speaker on the controller is a welcome addition, as is the touchpad.CONS:- Not a lot of games out right now.- Was promised controller charging on off mode, but it's only when the PS4 is on standby mode. A small letdown.All in all I recommend getting one now that is seems Sony has worked out the kinks of the launch day ones.

  After owning the PS4 for about two years the internal fan has completely stopped working which causes the system to shut down after having it on for a short time, rendering it unplayable. The PS4 has never been dropped or handled roughly so there is no reason that the fan should not be working. I now have to pay a total of about $40 for a new fan, thermal paste, and thermal paste remover so I can try to fix it myself. I've heard Sony charges around $100 to fix it so I will not be sending it to them for repair. I am very disappointed.

  Forget the “PRO”, the original old model is so entertaining to play on.  I’ve had it for quite a few years now and have been enjoying it since. Arrived well packaged without any damage at all. It is unfortunate however you have to buy more gigabytes or delete some game data in order to enjoy new games though, but oh well, it’s all business unfortunately.

  It's been 3 days now and the device seems to be working perfectly. There were very little cosmetic flaws nothing more than a slight scuff. Three stars because although it is pictured with a controller  it does not come with one.  I did try to get in contact with them beforehand to check if it came with a controller but because the item was in the warehouse they were not able to verify.

  I received the PS4 this week shipped directly from Amazon and have had no problems. The system was the easiest console to set up and the graphics are truly amazing. Hopefully, the developers can stop pushing back release dates and launch some games this Spring/Summer though!If ordering from Amazon, beware of the packaging. I suspect the reason for so many systems being delivered broken is simply because the packaging is absolutely horrible. Literally, one piece of bubble wrap at the bottom and nothing on top. I couldn't believe they would ship a $400 item in such a careless way. I am still baffled by the lack of (basically nothing) protection.

  First I want to state that my initial launch edition was doa out of the box with the pulsing blue light and no video defect.  In less than a week amazon had a brand new one to me and this one worked perfect.  Props to amazon for quick turnaround, they always seem to make things right.After finally getting a chance to play this new console I can easily see what all the hype is about.  Not only does the system look very hansom sitting next to it's older brother (ps3), it's very quiet even with a disc in the drive.  The UI is simple and easy to navigate, I had no problems figuring out where to go or what to do.  The controller really feels like a quality item.  If feels really sturdy and comfortable in my hands.  The new touch pad and little speaker is a nice addition.  Sony didn't skimp on this thing.The first game I downloaded was of course Resogun and while it seems like a simple arcade type shooter, it still finds a way to show off what the system can do.  Very fun and addictive.  After that I popped in Assassin's Creed 4 and was in awe of how the game plays and looks.  It truly feels next gen.  I'm very excited for what the future holds in the PlayStation 4!  Also, I'd like to add that the share options are very cool and make it so simple to show people what you're playing.  It really impressed me.I would highly recommend getting this system if you're thinking next gen.

  What more is there to say about this system except, if you want the most diverse range of games out there, then this is where you should be playing. General game players see the word indie game and think that just because a game is not Uncharted, Halo, Call of Duty, etc., that the games are not worth it. There are so many games coming out for this thing that are not mainstream yet are mainstream quality that your head would spend. Couple that with the Vita connectivity and PS+, what more can be said?

  On paper this device is very powerful and capable. The release titles and release apps are, in my opinion not enough to make you Rush and buy this.Dual shock 4 is a major improvement and just feels good in your hands.I wish sony would of released stronger titlesI bought kill zone and FIFA 2014 and although graphics are better than ps3 you don't get that ""wow"" factor as we saw with the ps3 and xbox on release.Furthermore Sony made it so you can just connect any Bluetooth device,especially your old devices you bought for ps3 which kinda sucks on their sideWe will see how this works out later and I'll update my review when I'm a little more impressed

  Let me start off by saying that yes, I did receive a blue light brick first. Yes I was pissed off. I called amazon to tell them they sent me a brick, after the amazon lady told me to keep turning it on & off she made me call sony to get some tech support. After calling sony & waiting 15 mins to actually talk to someone for them to tell me it's nothing they could do about the pulsating blue light I called amazon back. I talked to a guy this time & he was trying to get me to call sony back but I wasn't having it so then we started the process to get me another one. I did pay for one day shipping, but my replacement came with regular shipping speed. Besides the bumpy customer service I am still satisfied.NOW THE SYSTEM...I absolutely love it. The user interface was confusing at first but it kinda still gives you the same feel as the PS3 UI. I breeze through it now. I like that you can integrate with Facebook & twitter & you can hit the share button on the controller to show all your peasant Facebook friends with previous gen systems the PS4 graphics.I have knack, COD, & tomb raider definitive edition as of right now. Tomb raider probably has the best graphics I've seen on a system so far, however even though knack is pretty cartoony the graphics are still VERY sharp & you can still tell it's next gen. I recently went back to my ps3 & fired up ""The Last Of Us"" which is pretty much some of the best PS3 graphics you'll find, & they looked terrible compared to what I'd become used to. Like, absolutely terrible.What I don't like so far is only that it's too early in next-gen gaming for certain things I guess. For example, there is one theme you're getting. & that's it. I also have 3D blu-rays that I can't play because the console doesn't support it yet. There isn't a whole slew of games but people are being ridiculous saying it's nothing out here.I absolutely love the controller. Brand new feel it's not like the transition from dualshock 2 to dualshock 3 you can feel the difference. I love the new triggers & the touch pad is very cool. Tomb raider is the only game I have so far where you use it. Can't wait to see how other games will utilize the controller in the future. Only thing I really dislike is the fact that the dualshock 4 dies...FAST! I remember probably using dualshock 3 for maybe 40ish hours off of 1 charge, but you're using dualshock 4 for probably 8 hours before you need another charge.Overall besides those few small things I didn't like I love the system & I don't know if I still want a Xbox One now.

  Works great I have had since initial release and this is a second one I purchased for a vacation home. Games look great. Wireless speeds not great though. I have in the same room as the router and i get maybe 25 or 30 meg. when I hard wire in I get over 50 and my broadband is 150. I like the party chat with my friends even if we are playing different games helps us stay in touch. Graphics for the games I have are excellent. I used to be an xbox guy but the PS3 converted me.

  After months of waiting for this system I would say it was a definite worth of wait. I order the system in late Jan and receive it less than a week from ordering it. I have seen a few reviews and videos of shipping from here and was worried due to the packaging epically living overseas.The package was very well protected with a thick bubble wrap as well as some air packs. So as to ensure the package well kept safe.On to the goodies. I was very impressed on the detail and design. the PS4 was very sleek and beautiful. I was very worried because you hear some stories of the blue light of death and so far no problems. Easy to install and man using the interface took a little while but not to long and was welcomed to the world of the ps4.The Controller: Holding and using the new ds4 also took a little bit to get use to it but i love the feel of the controller. the only issue i had far so with it was the light bar but it is what it is. It had a very sleek design as well to go along great with the system itself. I am going to buy another one at a later date.I also hear a few people on here with some wondering if they would still come with 30 day PS plus as well as the 10 credit. I received  mine with the 10 credit and the 30 day music trial so no free 30 day. but to me its fine only because i already have the plus which has it perks!overall the system is great and i love it especially syncing with my Vita. I wish that they had more games out especially during the release. But i think the best is yet to come So thanks Amazon for helping me stay a PlayStation fan for life

  I love it! I was looking to get an Xbox1 as so many people had an Xbox360 but when I saw that PS4 was outselling Xbox 2 to 1, it was a no brainer. Also, the hardware is definitely better on the PS4 and no software tweaks will bridge the gap. Yes, the Xbox1 is pretty damn comparable and you might not notice the differences with your naked eye or on certain televisions but the difference is there in the hardware, no doubt about it.I like this PS4 as it is fast to load up, quick to boot games, and it does everything I want. I definitely would recommend this to all my friends!The controller is also heavier than before which makes it feel pretty sturdy. I actually have dropped it 1 time and it has no scratch on it (thank god). Also, the controller is a little bigger and feels better than the Dual Shock 3 of the PS3.All in all, I have had no issues and I bought it in February. Amazing!!!!! Cant wait for the games coming up in the summer to see how developers have taken advantage of the hardware in the PS4.

  I am rating the console not DOAs. For the time being this is my review of my PS4. It gets 5 stars atm but it does need some firmware updates, and obviously, sorting out the usual launch issues and Chinese manufacturing issues will take time. I feel bad for those that got DOAs and I discuss that at the bottom a bit. But for now I have to review my system.For what it is the is the greatest console ever released. The DS4 is near perfect, although I still could use more heft on the backside it is about as good as the original design can get at this point. I mark it slightly higher than the 360 controller and that is high praise. The UI is sweet and fast. MUCH faster than the XMB ever was. Doing things like sharing stuff, contacting people, and general social fare has never been easier on any console. The Xbox One looks to have the same thing going on.As for the power this thing puts out games like KZSF are clearly in the top tier of PC games with some framerate issues and a tad lesser IQ. Everything else is stunning for a launch game. I have no idea where all the bad reviews are coming from but I can guess as with every launch a few people were well paid for their efforts. All in all Sony has done a remarkable turnaround. This console means business, is very quiet, and produces the best launch graphics in any FPS ever for a console. So much so that with just a little extra here and there the game would be top end PC fare if it could produce a stable 60 FPS framerate. Still, we do get a solid 30-40 in campaign, and damn does it look good, and about 40-60 in multiplayer. SO the PS4 is clearly doing its job and the promises of 1080p are here to stay.As far as everything else we need firmware updates. The system is so far pretty bare bones for options. Still don't have all the HDMI sound options needed for receivers, the PS3 got this patch at some point, so my receiver in stereo still sees like 3/4/.1 from the PS4 but it works just with a slightly higher noise floor. There are other things that should carry over from the PS3 as well in time.The DOAs no one really knows what happened. It could be that the extra demand and hence the extra locations of manufacturing produced too much strain or outright sabotage no one knows. It is a fairly small number of dead systems comparing last gen where the console apocalypse basically hit everyone at some point in the launch groin. All I have to say is I can never go back to my PS3. The thing is dated as hell, slow as hell, and has an awful controller. The PS4 is here to stay.

  Not necessarily needed at the moment as I do still play my PS3 and PSVita. But they are all connected via the PlayStationNetwork, its a pretty nice feeling. Graphics are fantastic, blue-ray quality is still there and they even simplified the menu and general options. The controllers also seem to melt in my hands, they are by far my favorite out of all PS controllers; it also features a nice touch pad in the middle as well as a small speaker. At the moment this is only used in some games, while other games take advantage of the controllers lighting effects (Tomb Raider). All in all this is a big step forward for all Sony PlayStation players, might not need to get it just yet but it is a very nice option!

  Countless reviews have already said how great the PS4 is, let me complain about the one big issue Sony's new system for game management. Each and every game, regardless of if you have the disc or download code, must be loaded onto your hard drive. Soon enough it becomes a matter of storage management before each new game you buy. Take this as a warning and be sure to buy the largest hard drive you can afford for your system.

  I've put the system through a major stress test and everything works.  The system works and is fully functional.  OS is quick and responsive.  Games install and load quickly.  Being able to install things in the background is nice.  It's also on the quieter side.Current issues (supposedly fixed in a future update):No Bluray 3D SupportNo MP3 SupportNo ability for custom soundtrackCurrent issues outside of firmware:No official Remote (App works great for navigating OS, but doesn't work for Amazon Prime, at least the Netflix app works to navigate Netflix via your phone)I will update my review as I have had more time with the system.  No quirks or crashes yet.I do want to comment on Amazon's packaging.  They put the PS4 in a big box..  Put a couple bubble bags over it. Nothing was tight and nothing would of been protected.  Only one side had a few bubble bags, even those were just lazily placed on top and didn't fill the box on the one side they were on.

  Design, Price and Power - IMO ps4 is the best of the current generation consoles. It is the most powerful of the 3 major consoles boasting realistic graphics in 1080p. Multiplatform games shared between  Ps4 and Xbox One tend to run better and look slightly better on the ps4. Considering the vast overlap of titles between the big 2 consoles Ps4 is an obvious purchase for gamers who typically play multiplatform titles. The pricepoint is very fair as well. Ps4 launched for 399 dollars compared to Xbox Ones 499 dollar price. A good value considering it is the more powerful console. Design wise Ps4 is sleek and sexy. It is similar in size to Sonys PS3 slim meaning it will fit nicely and look good in most spaces. The system can run a bit hot though in closed spaces. The system uses Blu Ray discs just like Ps3 did. This model came with a 500GB HDD. I felt they could have made it bigger but 500GB was fair for the price.Game Library - Ps4 is a multiplatform centric console. 95% of the good games are going to be available on other platforms or last gen remasters. This is good in that Ps4 owners will never have a shortage of great games to play but also a bit disappointing in that Ps4 has few exclusives that make it stand out in a unique way. But compared to the competition PS4 is the best option as it gets the best versions of multiplats on consoles and has enough exclusives to keep things intresting including standout exclusive The Last Of Us Remastered which IMO is one of the best games ever in terms of storyline and gameplay. A true masterpiece which Ps4 owners need to own.Online - The Playstation Network  in still intact. You have a modern online store featuring various forms of media, mainly movies and videogames. The biggest difference is the pricetag. Playing online games will now cost you 50 dollars a year. I found this very disappointing as someone who enjoyed PS3s free online. This is probably my biggest criticism of the Ps4. I feel like paying for online is silly considering PC gamers still get free online play in multiplats.Overall 9/10It's the best option for hardcore gamers in the console realm. Sony clearly listened to criticism of the PS3 and priced the PS4 accordingly. On the downside I can't give it a perfect 10 because the HDD is a bit small and not future proofed and paying 50 dollars for online is a bit absurd. But the bottom line stands if you are in the market for a videogame console PS4 is the best option for the majority of gamers.

  I have a PC and love playing on it, but one thing that i kind of lost passion for growing up was upgrading it with new ram and vid cards. so i turned to a ps3 and didnt look back, i still use my pc for steam summer sales and what not but after getting hooked on alot of ps exclusive games, i decided to stay with the ps family. I sold my ps3 and bought a ps4 and i can safely say im loving it so far. The games i have right now are BF4 and infamous 2nd son. I recomend those games because bF4 gives you the scope of what the ps4 can do in MP games (64 players and huge maps). second son looks beautiful and the new framerate looks amazing (mostly when theres 2 or 3 building falling down and you're just causing more chaos with your smoke powers). lucky for me theres so many more games coming, a personal favorite, The last of us remastered (i finished it on ps3 and cant wait to replay it on PS4). I recomend watching a few youtube gamplay videos on youtube and videoreviews of games to see which one fits your taste. Its not much different from the xboxone or the pc when it comes to the visuals of games, alot of art styles out there and gameplay styles. In the end it just comes down to what kind of games you like.The added features are really nice, my favorite being the ability of the PS4 to multitask, I am a very busy person during week days so i cant really play it during work days. But when i am able to play it, I like to start the day by turning it on, playing a game for an hour or 2, go get my bowl of cereal, hit the ps button, start a youtube video (on the browser :(, but the youtube app is coming soon, which i miss from the ps3) finish my breakfast, hit the ps button again and jump right back into where i left the game.I am really happy with this console, no problems so far. theres alot more to tell you about this console but you will be better off going to sony youtube channel (or any other channel) and read and see ALL the capabilities of the system.

  I got mine on 24th right before Christmas. I was a bit worried the blue light of death like other reviewers claimed, but fortunately everything works perfect.The setup is a breeze and straight forward. After connected to internet, the instruction prompted me update the firmware to 1.52, the procedure was fast and smooth, after reboot from the new firmware, all the applications are available on the dashboard ready for download and installed.I tried a couple of apps: Netflix and Amazon Prime, they both works flawless. you can switch the app and resume the video from where you left. The web browser works good once I get use to the control. I also tried a couple of games, they launched fast and all works perfect.I took one star away for the following reason:1. the software is not quit there yet: the web browser doesn't support flash video, i.e in youtube, it only plays HTML5 videos. ironically it's portable cousin ps vita can play both no problem.2. the current available apps are highly functional overlap and lack of apps in other genre. for example, facebook, skype, youtube apps will be nice if they are coming in the future.3. the Sony server seems not stable or over loaded sometimes. I have encountered fail to connect to server a couple times when I was setting up the console.4. the battery life of the control is not so great. the way to turn it off is kind of clumsy. the blue light can't be turn off unless the control is off, it's kind of annoying.Over all I am happy with my purchase.

  Apparently, I'm not allowed to tell others how much better this was wrapped and protected than a new one is. Even though this was listed as used or display model, you'd never know it was. I did not see any cosmetic damage, and everything worked perfectly. The battery life of the controller is substantially longer than the battery life of my older PS4, even though they are the same model. I'm also glad I was able to get a second system without being forced to buy some game I already had or didn't want. This was one of the few I found that wasn't a package deal, it was only what I wanted.

  Great console which really shows how PlayStation has matured in time. While it's specifications are endlessly debated as in all console generations; they are first class and covered by other raters. What is notable is how well the PlayStation OS and online network has evolved from the PS3 days. Very well designed OS and GUI, with quick transitions and a high degree of social media and video/image sharing built in that really separates this from the competition.The game library is still a bit thin, as most early days for a generation are; but with the ease of development, the upcoming library is very exciting. Sort of has a PlayStation2-esque feel to it.Recommended for any console buyers. It's time to jump in.

  I jumped into the ""next-gen"" with some hesitation. I preordered the PS4 within the first hour of availability and held onto it, despite some back and forth, until it was released. Needless to say, I'm mostly happy with the purchase - though I know it will only be more valuable to me over time.Let's start with the drawbacks...Multimedia (lack thereof). The PS4 is a gamer's system in a day and age where the newest tech gadgets try to cater to everyone's cravings. If you are used to the Xbox 360 and having rather robust multimedia offerings at your fingertips, the relatively bland front-end of the PS4 and it's slim offerings of apps/software (carried over from the PS3) will feel a bit underwhelming.You are going to run out of space soon. The 500 GB drive will be under heavy demand as you amass your PS4 library. Even physical copies of games will need massive installs (NBA 2K14 took a healthy 45 GB worth of space after a long install). Even swapping out a HD won't help you all that much in the long run. If you plan on gaming with this rig for the next 5-10 years, you will likely threaten to go over 1 TB worth of DLC, updates and games. This is a problem that both next-gen consoles face going forward.The next-gen leap isn't all that spectacular...yet. Take a look at NBA 2K14 and FIFA 14. Nice and smooth, a quality ""upgrade"" to the current-gen offering, but hardly what you would expect from a generation leap - however, those two games represent the largest graphical leap of any of the launch games. Truth be told, it will get a lot better, faster, but for now, the offerings are mostly glossed-over ports. It will be interesting to see how much this ""leap"" evolves in the next couple years.With that out of the way, I'm very happy with my PS4 ""upgrade"". A few months ago I sold my PS3 in anticipation while holding onto the Xbox 360. The PS4 feels like the perfect gaming machine. It's a sleek design, from the console itself right down to the awesome Dual Shock 4 - which could easily be the best gaming controller ever created. After all the installs/etc (hey, next-gen is just going to have that kinda stuff, we'll have to deal with it) it's generally very easy to get right into a game. PS Plus is a very nice deal going forward and provides a steady diet of great ""free"" games for the nominal yearly fee. Out of the gate there are plenty of very solid games at launch (despite not being all that much better than the current-gen counterparts as mentioned before) with a community that is growing at a rapid rate - there is no worry that people won't be buying into the next-gen at least.The real key is this. For $100 less than the competition you still get a very powerful gaming machine that lacks some multimedia aspects and the motion/voice recognition abilities (which you can still gain with the PS4 Eye if you want that stuff). Other than that, both the PS4 and Xbox One generally will offer the same types of experience at a raw gaming level. You certainly can't go wrong with the PS4 if you are just choosing one console going forward - it's already gained a strong share of the market at this early stage and seems to be a very safe investment for the long term (as it essentially won the ""public opinion"" war in the lead-up to launch).

  I ordered this used and it's still working great! I mostly play JRPGs, but my roommate has been using it for streaming on a weekly basis with no issues. Not sure where I am with the warranty, but I'll probably trade up before the next console to be safe.I've had this PS4 used for 2 years now and the only real probably was a bit of pet hair in the controller. Easy fix.

  I've had this console for 3 or 4 years no problems still going strong and planning to get the PS5 but this console, especially for the price it's pretty good, but I will recommend getting a hard drive with 2T so you can have more gigabits in your console because 500gb is not enough. You will probably get 5 games.

  So far, so good.  My wife has played Knack and enjoyed it.  If you like Ratchet and Clank, you would probably like it.  I've been playing Assassin's Creed: Black Flag and it is stunning on the PS4.  I have an EPSON 8350 Projector and it looks great on my 105"" screen.  I've also played Blu-ray on the system and streamed Netflix with no issues.  Can't wait for more games to come out.  I don't like FPS, so I'll be skipping those.The only thing I don't like is the lack of MP3 support.  I use my PS3 as a music hub, which I will continue to do, but it would be nice if I could hook my external HD of music up to the PS4 and do the same.  Maybe someday they'll release a patch for that.

  To put it simply; I am amazed, not only with the Sony PS4 console, but with Amazon's customer-centric business ethic. So this is a two part review/critique.Up first is Amazon. I was skeptical to pre-order a launch console to begin with let alone from any business that guarantees debut date delivery, but once again though Amazon shines through and my PS4 was waiting for me by my door when I came home from work. It is this kind of dedication that is missing in most business performance models nowadays. It seems most companies let the number of dollar signs do the steering, but when it comes to Amazon; they know that a happy customer means more in the long term. KUDOS!As for the PS4, the word to encapsulate every aspect of the system is SEAMLESS, from its modern sleek aesthetics to its speed. Once I unpacked, set up, and walked through the console's induction ceremony I downloaded and installed the system update. In a blink of an eye it was complete. I moved onto the code redemption for my preordered games. BOOM! done.  Then I downloaded some apps. BOOM! done.  I then moved through the interface looking and learning. Simplistic, ease of use, as is the perfected controller, granted I am still adjusting to the swiping sensor during game play, but I am getting there. The console on and off is a new aspect I have to learn to embrace. Not having a hard power button is different, but the tech exists so Sony is using it full force which just enhances the form following function by not having old school buttons to mash. Over all, I cannot wait to see future games. The potential for this system is probably no different from PC gaming, but the integration of social media and entertainment sets it apart and brings new dimensions and capability to gaming.So happy.

  I'm probably a xbox homer so coming from me, it's a big statement but the ps4 was the better launch console.  it was a more complete experience out of the box, you got what you expected, a video game console.  Performance wise, it's games perform better.  I thought xbox one had the better exclusive lineup by far, I thought forza was the best launch title either system, the ps4 launch lineup as far as exclusives go was laughable.  But in the end, the games they shared, they either looked the same or better on the ps4.  Kinect was more annoying then it should be so lack of a similar feature on the ps4 wasn't a big deal.  the vita remote play feature is a big plus for me, works very well.

  I pre-ordered this item right when it was available on June 10, 2013. I saw the E3 conference and I knew this would replace my 7 year old PS3.I received the console midday on November 15, 2013 with 3 games received before the console: Assassin's Creed 4, Killzone Shadow Fall, & Just Dance 2014. When I first turned ON the console it was easy to set up everything, the camera, HDMI, and Digit Out (audio).Games:The games look amazing compared to the last generation games. With the added memory, the maps remember where weapons/items you left on the ground (example all the enemies killed/their weapons, bullet holes, etc.). One downside of these games is that they install the whole game on the PS4's HDD. 3 games took about 110GB so most likely I'll be getting a bigger HDD in the coming years. The benefit of this is that games load up much faster. Also that games run in native 1080p meaning that no more games that have lower resolutions due to some factors.Videos:Well nothing new on videos since most people still have FHD TVs and Blu-Ray is the same. The only difference is the 4K support. Since I don't own any 4K Blu-Ray movies I can't comment on this. This doesn't mean that games will play in 4K.PS Camera: This camera is better than all cameras by PlayStation (obviously). It has dual 720p cameras that capture depth as long as recognizing faces. With Just Dance it works well. The only problem is that it doesn't work well with more than one person, it confuses between players. Not sure if it is the camera's fault or the game. Because the motion controllers still work flawlessly.Things I didn't like:The UI. I already have more than a dozen games and they are put in a single row. In order to find the game you haven't played in a while, you have to go across the whole list to get to it. I think it would be better if it had a column/row list and the option to order them alphabetically  or in order of last played.The features that were promised but still no date to when it is going to be released. They had a feature where you play a game and pause it, then put your system in standby mode, when you turn it back on it would return exactly where you left off.Overall this is a great system and I would highly recommend this to gamers and family people alike.

  Great looking machine, well designed and fantastically engineered. Small, quiet, can stand horizontally or vertically.User Interface is super fast, downloads are fast, game loads are fast.  Games look fantastic on PS4, no small part due to every game being true high definition 1080p.  Twitch streaming works great right out of the box.  There are 4 excellent Free-to-Play games available besides the retail games.  Also, Playstation Plus subscribers get 2 free game with their PS4 - ResoGun (super awesome game) and Contrast.  Oh, and there's a free month of PS+ in the box, plus $10 to spend at the PS Store.  I already bought FLOWER, a beautiful game that's 1080p and 60 frames per second - a sight to behold.THIS is the most powerful next gen game console, and will have a MUCH larger library of games than the compeition.Also, it should be said that the PlayStation4 does NOT INCLUDE a mandatory $150 NSA spy camera, posing as an advertising information gathering camera, posing as a gaming peripheral.

  I love my PS4, have since I got it. Mine did have a fatal error when I got it, however I did get my device sent in and they returned it after a while. Giving me a new one to play with that wasn't broken. I use it to play games and stream Netflix constantly. In fact...I mostly use it for Netflix. It's sad really...I paid a lot of money for a Netflix machine!

  Unpacked it and could hear a rattling inside it. Noticed all screws missing o the back except for one that was heavily damaged. Plugged it in, it sounded like a jet about to take off, main screen came on, put a new game in the console, the light went red and the system shot down by itself. Restarted it and same loud noise, it shot down by itself again. I recommend spending the extra $40 or $50 for a new system. Needless to say I returned it and am still waiting for my refund... I will never buy used gaming systems again

  buy it. it's perfect. My only complaint was the packaging it was sent in. Amazon sent this in a large box filled with other items I purchased. I know that is very standard but all the smaller items were loose in the box and the ps4 (in its own packaging) was also an inch shorter than the shipping box so it was also loose and moving freely in the box with the other items. Was very hard to carry from my door to my kitchen with everything shifting i can only imagine how it was to move from place to place and its bumpy ride in the back of the postal truck.

  I do pro reviews but don't have time for all that. In a nutshell this is the ultimate Fallout experience. It has all the atmospheric charm of FO3 and then some. All the customization of Skyrim and then some. Tons of weapons and armor. Many great companions, much more memorable characters, crisp graphics, a solid main quest, plenty of factions, and an immense map to wander.There is also an unprecedented building system that lets you create or enhance wasteland settlements wall by wall, piece by piece, furniture, power, everything all from core scavenged materials. You can settle them with people and establish trade routes. It's a big post nuclear 1950s style future epic that plays for hundreds of hours and is filled with creative Hotspot and quirky humor. You simply require this game.

  Before I write my Review please remember I am no fan boy, just a true gamer who follows “The Constitution of Gaming”. So take into consideration that this is just my opinion.“The Constitution of Gaming”A message to all fan boys: since you feel the need to ""protect a product"" like a dumb fanatic you are all retarded and hopefully will get back to sense one day, fan boys are not gamers by any means, they do not even follow the “Constitution of Gaming.”""The Constitution of Gaming"" Commitment (1-7)1- Any products not meeting expectations or hurting the worldwide gaming community should never be purchased and people hurting it should also be regarded as individuals potentially rejected globally.2- Major companies should never be considered an obligatory option and smaller developers should always be considered as an alternative.3- Always be honest about your feelings about a product and open-minded to a new one.4- Always respect a fellow gamer whether he is experienced or new to the game.5- Play fair and without cheating.6- A game should never be judged by only one Technic such as Graphics, Music or Story and should always begin with the analysis of the actual Gameplay first.7- As a gamer, you should always follow the Constitution of Gaming.^The Actual ""Constitution of Gaming""^ you can be ***king sure that I am sticking to it, if you cannot handle it; you cannot call yourself a true gamer.My Review- I have had my PS4 for about a full month and so far it has not given me any problems so no worries about the so called ""DOA"". I have owned a PS, PS2, Xbox, 360, and PS3 in that order and I have loved every system for as long as I have played them. The PS4 has a new interface but I wouldn't say I love it just yet, but I do prefer the PS3 interface to the PS4. I absolutely love the controller for the PS4. My first game to play on the next gen would be Killzone Shadow Fall. With the new touch screen (very user friendly/ Very easy to use) added on to the controller I believe it will add a whole new experience to the gaming community, and its just down right fun controlling your owl with the touch screen! My only regret about purchasing the PS4 is that Titanfall looks ***king amazing! But I have a 360 so I will just get it for that. I definitely recommend the PS4 to gamers who want a next gen system.-Friendly Gamer

  The Sony PS4 delivers as advertised.  However, I returned the product and will repurchase one later down the line when all the kinks are worked out.  I was a early adopter (Day One purchase).  Setting up the console was arduous because of my long wi-fi key.  Sony's firmware would time out before I could enter the full key.  Furthermore, there was no youtube app at the time of my purchase or DLNA support.  Lastly, I would like to see a Sony PS4 media remote in the near future for watching streaming media.  Aside from that, I loved the console.

  I love Sony and PS4 all together. Don't buy refurbished. Ours has had issues since we got it. Controllers wont stay connected (even new ones) and suppose the thing just doesn't want to respond to being turned on and will stay on one screen. Did not get much use out of it which is sad.

  I have been ecstatic thus far with my PS4 purchase.  I have enjoyed AC4, COD: Ghosts, and Killzone Shadowfall.  All the games have superb performance and graphics, and the OS and UI of the PS4 itself is very nice and easy to use.  The new Dual Shock 4 controllers are excellent.  Overall a great purchase so far.  The only downside I can think of is that this console is still new and the development of a library of games is still under way, so it may not have tons to offer the hardcore and time intensive gamer just yet, but per Sony between studios creating games and their work on backward compatibility through the Gaikai cloud scheduled for this year, the library is coming.

  Alright, so I know all of the negative reviews on here are based on ""bricked"" or ""DOA"" consoles; which is unfortunate for the person that received one but I'm sure Sony will fix any problems because there is a one year warranty on the console.  It sucks I get it and I would be pissed as well, but in all honesty it was expected and unlucky if you did get a console that didn't work.Now for the review, what can I say? Sony did an excellent job with the PS4.  The UI is much faster than the PS3's UI and it's simple and streamlined not that the PS3's XMB wasn't simple, it was just slow (imo the  xbox360 UI is cluttered but responsive).  Quitting a game and going to the UI is super quick.  I've tried remote play and it works! If you decide to use Sony's Music Unlimited service you can stream music in the background while playing a game; or download the app for your phone and you can listen to music on the go. The dualshock 4 is a great controller, I had some problems with it at first only because the analog sticks weren't ""broken in yet"" but I love it now.  The launch titles aren't the best Sony has to offer but it will get me through till the games I am really looking forward to come out in the next few months and years to come.  I can't wait to see what all of Sony's first party developers has in store for us gamers.  If you are on the fence about getting one, I say get one, don't let the bad reviews sway you away from purchasing a great console.  Now, if you are on the fence about getting a PS4 vs an XboxOne; that's a matter of choice and preference; for myself I like all the variety of exclusives Sony has compared to MS.  Last gen I felt like Sony had way more exclusives I liked compared to MS. Any way, Yes! The PS4 is GREATNESS!!!

  Definitely recommend this.  I oroginally ordered the pre-order ps4 that comes to you on release date.  Wanted to wait a while before writing a review.  New video game releases are starting to pick up now compared to when it first released.  Recently just purchased Infamous: Second Son and Watch Dogs comes out in a few more weeks.  These are the games that drew me to the ps4 in the first place.  Not to mention, they are coming out with a remastered edition of The Last of Us, one of my favorite games of all time.  These are still sold out in retail stores so probably Amazon is your best bet on purchasing one.

  It is time I need to upgrade my system since PS3 games are being phased out. Luckily I found one that wasn't too expensive. I still have to cough up a PS4 controller since it did not come with one. But I knew it didn't when I bought it. I did get it hooked up to my tv and confirmed that it does indeed work. Now I just need the games and controller and I'm golden.

  Despite a number of reviews saying Amazon's packaging was subpar for the PS4 launch, I received my console on launch day adequately packaged with no visible damage. After opening my package, I inspected both the HDMI port and included HDMI cable to make sure there was no visible metal pieces in the wrong spot. I then booted up the system and have had no issues since!The system is great, it boots up incredibly fast and there have been so many improvements since the PS3 that I would be here all day talking about them. While the launch lineup is a little lackluster, the number of games coming out in the next few months has made me extremely excited for the potential of this console. Killzone looks marvelous on this console and some of the cinematics just had me in awe as I played. I also purchased FIFA which also played without a hitch! The improvement in the fluidity of gameplay between the PS3 and PS4 on crossplatform games is so visible its not even funny.For those people who are complaining that there are features missing from the PS4, please keep in mind that when the PS3 launched it too was missing a lot of the features it eventually added to the console, and that console was $200 more at launch! I am 100% satisfied with the purchase and despite all the negative reviews, I don't think people should be concerned with the quality of the console. Every console launch has its hiccups and at one point the 360 had a 36% failure rate, so compared to that the PS4s problems are minuscule. Take my word for it, you won't regret picking up this console! It was built for the future of gaming unlike the Xbone which is focused mostly on multimedia.

  The Sony Playstation 4 is a great console!! I purchased this PS4 for my son for Christmas.  It came in its box with one controller, the necessary cords and booklets.

  I skipped the entre PS3 era, not a fanboy I just got an Xbox 360 for Xmas back then so that's what I rocked with. Got the Xbox one on launch and waited for a PS4 to become available for MONTHS.. Finally got lucky and saw amazon and not some independent seller sellin for 200+ over retail, and couldn't be happier. I love the UI of the PS4 Surprisingly more than my XB1, wish I could make custom themes though like on PS3 but no biggie, I haven't had any problems. I find myself using it more than my XB1 and I have TitanFall Lls, seriously tho it's great for everything. Games, movies, and Internet.Edit: I actually like the PS4 yi better but the Xbox one apps better. Internet is waay better on XBOX one. Better flash player so less restrictions on websites (for movie steamers) ;)

  I owned a Playstation 3 for several years before upgrading to this Playstation 4.  One thing that I really DON'T like about the 4 is that the indicator light is on the top (whereas the 3 had it on the front).  I have my Playstation on a very high shelf in a home theater setup, and I simply cannot see the top of it, so am always guessing as to its current power state.The other thing that I really DON'T like is how loud the fan is ... WAY louder than my Playstation 3's, and quite distracting when watching a movie at low volume.UPDATE 01/27/15 regarding the loud fan: I did some searching of some PS4 forums and learned that this is a somewhat common defect. The fan is variable speed, running only as fast as it needs to run in order to keep the CPU and GPU temperatures below a set value.  The temperature is sensed by a thermistor, and on some units the thermistor may have been faulty (reading really HIGH temperatures), thereby incorrectly indicating that the fan needs to run at full speed.  Anyway, I returned the unit to Amazon just barely within my return time limit window.  They sent me a new one pronto (even before the original one was returned ... I used the new box to return the old one), and the new one is completely quiet.  I'm updating my rating from 3 stars to 4.

  We bought both the PS4 and the Xbox One when they came out last year. Since then 90% of our gaming has been on the PS4. The PS4 we purchased from Amazon was actually the third one in our family. My youngest son bought one and I gave my launch edition to my oldest son so I wanted another one for myself. I've had a chance to play several titles that are available to both systems (Ghosts, Assassins Creed and Battlefield 4) and the PS4 versions clearly looked better with all three of those titles. I'll still play Xbox exclusives like Titanfall and Forza on the One, but all other games are going to be PS4 versions for now on.I was a hardcore 360 fan before with a Gamerscore of 32,000 on XBL. PS4 has completely changed my mind about Playstation.

  This is the console for gaming, IF and only IF you are ready for a higher definition experience than you can get on PS3.  Let's face it, if graphics/game performance isn't an issue, the PS3has a massive library of games (but it should also be noted that Sony is working on streaming those games to your PS4 with 'Playstation Now').I have had the console since launch and have played somewhat heavily ever since.  The controller puts it's seemingly competent predecessor to shame. the tension of the sticks is fantastic, which is very noticeable when playing fast paced shooters like BLR.PS Plus is required for online play but I honestly think PS Plus is an amazing value that might change the way we all play and think of games by offering everyone the same diverse pool of 'free' games via a subscription library (sound familiar? Basically a gaming Netflix).I play on a 52"" display so the resolutions and frame rates offered are a very smooth transition from last generation that is easy on the eyes.  If you want me to argue this console over any other next gen alternative, I will say that I only own the PS4 and plan to build a modular PC to run Windows and Steam OS for my living room.  And that's far more than enough next gen gaming goodness for me.

  Before my gush I would also ask people reading the one star reviews to sort by newest and see that the VAST majority of posts are unverified, meaning the user hasn't actually purchased a ps4.Amazing console, great free games and playstation plus games ready to go out of the box no purchase required (I already had a year of playstation plus)Remote play to my vita is a godsend, like for tonight... I couldn't sit out in the lounge room playing the ps4 as I was just too tired, so I just hopped straight to my vita, turned the console on from the vita and jumped straight into warframe with some friends. Even better warframe remaps the controls to something better suited for the vita, it takes a little getting used to but it works MUCH better than using the l2 r2 pads at the back, I wish that sony would have moved the touch pads for l2 r2, l3 r3 more towards the corner and less the center, I feel I could use them more as buttons that way -shrugs-Software wise I am missing video playback but they have now said that they will be bringing it in a future patch so I am okay with this.On another note fantastic controller, I have had my second controller for around two weeks now and have a good feel of it... No other game pad compares. I still rather keyboard and mouse over controller for the most part, but this controller is fantastic for everything I wouldn't want a kb mouse for.I would also like people to realize that with WELL over 1million launch editions shipped by amazon ALONE there will be a seemingly large number of failures in hardware... it is what happens with electronics, the difference this time around is this is the biggest console launch in history on a pure numbers basis and people are more connected than ever so the complaints can be heard loudly.The actual failure rate of the console is extremely low (revealed to actually be lower than sony's initial projection of 0.4%) and many of the issues have very simple fixes... My console and the vast majority are fine.there are also scare images going around about console temperatures... the console operates at a very similar temperature to the ps3 slim, people just don't notice it because they aren't constantly touching their old ps3 slim nor are they having images posted about. Some consoles may fault, but at the moment that number is very very low.Ultimately this is a great and cheap companion gaming machine to my more powerful and main gaming pc.SO VERY GLAD TO BE PLAYING AT 1080p!!!

  I see complaints and it's just proof some people won't be pleased. I ordered this and I got it in less then 4 days. I haven't had a single problem with it, and I've had it for over a month now. I have put it in stand by mode, and used it for several hours. Not one flaw at all. Don't waste your money on an xbox. PS4 is amazing. There isn't a giant selection of games available right now, but the future holds great things. Don't be fooled by lame reviews. Odds are that the complainers are at fault for the issues they're having, or just trying to get something for free. The seller treated me amazing, and I am very thankful for their awesome service.

  I just got my ps4 and it came a day early for me which made me happy. All was sealed and brand new with no problems. I followed directions and hooked everything up and everything is working just fine. I have no problems with this machine, so far, but I've been a big fan of Sony since the beginning. The graphics are outstanding. The controller works with my hands and fits perfect. I didn't research the controller very well so when it spoke it startled me, lol. Very cool. I got the one year subscription and I like getting one free game a month. I'm so happy amazon restocked the ps4 because for a long time I couldn't find it in my area in any store.

  Obviously we LOVE our PS4. It's been nothing but amazing for us and we were so lucky to get the last batch before Christmas day. It shipped super fast and on time as well. It was a surprise for my boyfriend and after wrapping it and hiding it behind all the other gifts, he literally had no idea. When he opened it, he was speechless that I actually was able to find one in stock and trick him into thinking I didn't' get one (since he wasn't able to find one in-store or online when he looked). We also have the Xbox One and he prefers this console over that one - in case you are deciding between the two for a gift.

  reviews have been out for 3 + months already by now so why does mine matter ? It doesn't, but all you need to know is that Sony's next gen console is worth every penny.  The interface looks interesting and weird at first and i thought i didn't like it but, after a good 5 - 10 min it hit me i got it.  Your home page or main start screen is filled with past history challenges and feats friends challenges against yours active gameplay of your friends.  Your start screen is increased in content by; how many games you have and actively shows your library, by connecting to social networks it integrates the gaming community on PSN with all your friends to see.the playstation vita second screen experience and remote play is by far one of the coolest things ever, their is virtually no lag at all, even while i was playing Killzone SF.My overall opinion....if you call yourself a ""gamer"" this is the console for you.  The competition doesn't stand a chance right now if everything keeps going in Sony's favor.

  After less than 2 years the CD drive stopped working entirely. It wouldn't eject the disks using the appropriate buttons, and would intermittnetly not read the discs, either.

  Had both previous generation consoles.  Amazon packed it as well as any item I've ever seen, plus the PS4 box was well prepared for shipment too.  Could not be happier with my PS4.  Interface is fast and easy enough to understand.  My PS3 used to dislike being hooked up by hdmi to my LG tv.  The PS4 has not has a problem using hdmi with the same television.  Switching between games and media apps (amazon prime, crackle) has been smooth and impressive.  No load time switching from Cheers on Amazon Prime back to Assassins Creed 4 (that had been suspended previously).  New dual shock controller is as good as all the podcasts have been saying.  Have not had a problem with heat yet but system is in fairly open tv stand off of the ground.

  I've owned this console since launch day and each passing year I'm more and more disappointed with it.It seems like every other day Sony is announcing a brand new game for the PS4, but this always ends up being an old indie PC game that has been ported over to the PS4. Sony keeps releasing old indie PC ports, games that are 4+ years old, but marketing them as brand new games!The reason I bought a PS4 was to play the exclusive titles from Sony. I was looking forward to some quirky JRPGs and other foreign content straight out of Japan that I couldn't otherwise get on PC. Unfortunately the PS4 has only a handful of truly exclusive games and it's extremely rare when a new exclusive is announced. The PS Store and in turn my PS+ Instant Games Collection is littered with multiplat indie games and various other garbage that I've already played to death years ago on PC.So far, the only games I’ve been able to enjoy on PS4 are Bloodborne, Killzone, and a few of the PS3 exclusives they’ve re-released for PS4 such as The Last of Us, and Uncharted Collection. The 100’s of other games they’ve brought to the PS4 are either already in my Steam library, or could easily be purchased for a lower price on the Steam store.Now don’t get me wrong, I don’t mean for this to come off as a pro-pc-master-race review or anything. Just try to understand where I’m coming from.In my situation, I have a capable PC, I have a library of Steam games that I’ve been accumulating over 10+ years. I'm looking for exclusives that I could not play on my PC.In my case I truly feel that I would have been better off buying a Wii U or 3DS because of Nintendo’s heavy focus on first party exclusive games and it’s extensive library of highly rated games. I ultimately regret my decision to buy the PS4.Maybe your situation is similar, maybe you should get a Nintendo console too.Of course maybe you don't have a PC, and maybe you've never heard of any of the titles Sony is releasing on PS4. If that is the case, then you could probably benefit from a PS4 and your purchase would be justified. The PS4 is definitely the best PC gaming alternative on the market. If you’re unable to buy or maintain a PC then there is no doubt that PS4 is the way to go.On a side note, the PS TV / PS Vita are a great buy if you're a PC gamer. It has so many incredible exclusive games that you won't be able to play anywhere else. I've spent 100's of hours playing through many different JRPGs on that thing. And the systems and games are cheap as chips these days!

  The system i bought from them would not turn on untill the second or third attempt each time when booting up.I emailed them they told me they tested the system and I probably needed to update it.The system now shuts down at random times and won't turn on.I should have put it In a box and sent back the day I got it. Your are better off to spend the little extra money and get a system that will work.

  I ordered my counsel from amazon at the midnight release.  I received my console that following monday and have played it non stop.  The system and the UI work so flawlessly together.  The next gen experience is here and is amazing.  over the past 8 years I had an xbox 360 and I loved it to death.  However, in my opinion, the ps4 trumps the xbox one and all other counsels out there.  The graphics in the ps4 are so amazing that when you play on anything else the graphics look awful.  The ps4 also has the best hardware and specs of any counsel to date.  This means that video game companies can make games with much better graphics for the ps4 than the xbox one.  I have also had absolutely no problems with my counsel.  The future of gaming is bright!  Buy a PS4 you will not regret it.

  Love it. I wish it was backward compatible though. When getting rid of my PlayStation 3, I had to also give away many of the ps3 games. But overall this is a good upgrade. Other non-game features such as Netflix and Amazon are good too. I didn't try Spotify as I already subscribe to Google music. I waited more than three years for the price to drop before purchasing.

  Finally the PS4 has arrived and we are able to embark on the next-gen of console gaming.Pros:+Controller(DualShock 4) is a definite upgrade which feels better in every way than it's predecessors.  The touch screen/speaker adds a bit to the gaming experience.+System Design: Sleek and small.  It's surprising how they managed to make this system the size it is.+Interface: Smooth and easy to use+Media Sharing: Save screenshots/videos at the touch of the button in addition to live streaming.Cons:- DVD/Blu-Ray Playback: As it stands now the Playback of movies isn't as good as the PS3.  This will probably change in time and once they release a separate movie remote this will not be an issue.Overall:PS4 is a nice step forward as a mighty powerhouse for gaming.  I am definitely happy with my purchase and I look forward to all the PS4 games to come out in the future.

  with its sleek new look, super fast and responsive controls, and not to mention the best graphics card on any console, the ps4 is my system of choice. load time are fast and smooth (including downloading time). The online multiplayer is a HUGE improvement from the ps3 and the graphics are crisp and amazing. So far out of all the games I played for the ps4, Battlefield 4 is the only one that really looks like a next gen title. despite all the bad media the game is getting, I have had very few problems with it. as of the latest patches I haven't had any problems with it, def worth it a play through though. As for the PS4, I can't wait to see what this powerful mat chine is going to be capable of.

  I Love it. Personally my PS4 came perfect with all the wires worked perfect immediately no problems.  The controller casing is a little creaky but affects the use of it in no way.  Just remember no matter what any other reviews say, when you buy from amazon if it's broke or not what was pictures Amazon will gladly and easily let you return it free of charge. They will gladly and easily refund you or send you a replacement product free of charge. Have patience, have faith and order yourself a cost efficient PS4 today! :)

  This is my first foray into anything PlayStation.  Having played on Xbox and Xbox 360, I was a little afraid to try something new.  Overall I am very impressed with the new console.  One of the big differences is that the battery is built into the console and there's no huge power brick taking up space.  The graphics are spectacular and I can't wait to see programmers reach its full potential.  The standby mode is great when you are gone for a while because it will download all the updates while you are away.  The big fault is that sometimes it's hard to tell if the updates are downloading and/or updating or possibly stuck.  If you are into games and graphics, this console is a perfect fit.  Xbox One spent so much time trying to be everything that I feel they have dropped the ball on games and graphics.

  Really enjoying the PS4 so far. I think my biggest gripe are the lack of good games available for it at launch. I have been playing the free games with my Playstation plus 30 day trial. System is nice and small and quite compared to my PS3. A few gripes I have is the lack of CD playback, MP3 support and DLNA support. I know those will be coming soon so I'm not stressing about it quite yet. I will rate it FIVE stars once those features are added. Once games like the new Uncharte and a few other ones come out for it, then we will appreciate our purchase more. In the meantime I am just enjoying it more as a blu-ray player and streaming device till the content is there. I also believe with updates down the road this will improve the way the PS3 did back in the day.One more side note. If when your watching a blu-ray and you try and get the DTS-HD Master Audio and or True -HD audio to light up on your receiver, you have to change that setting when your in the movie by hitting the options button on the remote and going to audio settings. Why Sony didn't include this in the settings menu is beyond me.

  Great Console.  Reliable although it does not play PS3 games.  This is not the 4k compatible playstation.  Can download and play games directly from the playstation store and can use Playstation Vue if you subscribe to watch television programs.  VUE also works like a DVR and will record programs even if your playstation is offline.

  all I can say is that I have not turned on my xbox one/advertisement console, since I purchased a ps4.I have 2 xbox 360's and an xbox one.all I have used since ps4 is ps4.Microsoft's console is like a big advertisement where everything you want to change is hidden in some new place you never heard of.  I wish that Microsoft would quit renaming s*** we have been using for years.I wish that Microsoft would quit using the xbox platform for anything other than gaming.  its a gaming console, not a money machine.ps4 is straight forward with no bs and the games really do blow you away.not only in graphics and the other crappy benchmarks that all the homo gamers worry about but in this way, it is MUCH different and more challenging...ps4 games do not lead you on.  I mean that they allow you to discover the answer to the puzzle, it's not obvious and with ms xbox games, you typically are lead down a path of gameplay or discovery.  it's hard to explain but the games are just designed differently and they are beautiful overall.enjoy!jp

  Had to upgrade to the new PS4 in order to play the new Rockband4 game coming out:  boy am I disappointed!  The PS4 is a shackled husk of it's former self.  The interface is ugly and unwieldy.  There is no support for 3D displays, making my 3d TV, games and BluRays superfluous.  There is a web browser, but it too is nannied, blocking content and downloads.  There is no way to load your purchased movie and TV content onto the hard drive, each viewing streams from their servers, eating up your data allowance.  As far as I can tell the only thing this one does that the other one does not is streaming games, and that too will eat up your data plan.  And there is much that this version does NOT do that the PS3 did, such as holding all my music content and digital movies offline, an adult-oriented browser, 3D support, I am sure I will find more as I own the device.  My recommendation if you liked the PS3 is to buy a couple more of them.  They will be sought after in a short time, and probably worth more than a new PS4.

  I have been a fan of Sony products for some time now. I have tried Xbox and Microsoft products but have never really found them to be reliable or user friendly. The new PS4 is quite amazing. The ease of access to content and menus is a plus. And the ability to swap out hard drives and upgrade your system was a major selling point.  I'm sure both systems have advantages and disadvantages, but for me , I am glad I purchased the PS4. It's. $100 cheaper and easy to use. The games are great. Most come in 1080p and most upcoming ones will as well.  Overall I have enjoyed owning the new system these past few months.

  I can't say much that hasn't been said already.

  I'm not going to turn this into some crazed review or war with the Xbox clan, plain and simple, this machine is the best one yet!! The graphics are ridiculous and often times jaw dropping, the game play is so fluid and perfect, that you can get lost in virtual world so easily! Sony put some thought into this machine and it has been worth every penny I have invested. So simply put, its an amazing system and you will not be disappointed and if you are then, you already had issues and no one here can help you with those.

  My husband was skeptical about buying the PlayStation through amazon. But I went ahead and did it since Amazon was the only company who at the time was selling it. When we received it,we were sooooo excited to finally get the PlayStation 4. The graphics on it are so much better than anything else. The ease of use on it is wonderful. No exhausting updates like the Xbox. We are extremely happy with the PlayStation 4.

  The controller provided with this device is beyond faulty. The headphone jack doesn’t connect properly, and the controller vibrates constantly even when not being used. If it is switched on or connected to power it will vibrate at high speed even if untouched. This only stops when it is turned off. I live in a remote town and would like to know how this can be replaced with a controller in working order.

  Why i chose 5 stars:  The console came on time, unopened, and it functions perfectly.  I feel for the people that got the ""Dead on Arrival"" models - that's terrible.  Luckily, I did not get one of these.Pros:- The controller gets the ""most improved"" award.  Awesome.  the joysticks have less movement range but greater resistance, allowing for the system to interpret smaller movements as greater distances even though they don't move as far.  Really helps with precision.  Ever try to whip around and aim at someone but you move too far?  it's easier to control now.- Easy to switch between games and other apps.  You can download while playing/watching other apps and games now, so this is a great improvement as well.- All digital.  I don't need to go to a gamestop and have some smelly turd try and sell me a strategy guide.  EVER AGAIN.- Crisp graphics, native 1080P.  I dont have an Xbox thus cannot compare, but I've been told it only has 720P.- Can download a plethora of games at once.  Need to update one while playing one, or update two at once? No problem.Cons (nothing major!)- No idea if I'm doing the PS3 > PS4 game switchover correctly.  I'm downloading COD for $9.99 as we speak.  Will the PS4 somehow know I already own the digital PS3 version?  Am i wasting several hours waiting for this to download?  Who the heck knows.- I've been fidgeting with the console for a while, can't tell how it should sit in my entertainment center.  It's a rhombus, i mean, it's hard to make it look good in there.- I was hoping for some kind of FAQ onboard, but I have no idea what I can do, and what i cant do.  can i pause downloads to make one download go faster?  doesn't look like it so far.  If i start netflix, will my download pause?  Nobody knows.- The headset it comes with is garbage.  You spent years developing this console, and that's the headset you ship?  The ps3 blutooth headset it far superior to the wired mess they give you, so I'm going to see if this pairs.Tips for your own purchase (or things i would have done differently):- Make sure you have plenty of cash for games, PSN, and a decent TV.  I dont recommend getting this puppy ""half-assed"".  You'll want to have $50 for a year of PSN (~$4.00 per month), ~$120.00 for at least a few games, and make sure you have a native 1080P tv.  Really, youre spending ~600.00 to get this baby up and running full steam, with 2 games.- Charging dock looks cool but thus far has proven unnecessary.- Make sure you hang onto your PS3 discs that promised PS4 carry over.  You NEED to put the PS3 disk in to have the game carryover to PS4.  If you got the digital version, i dont think this is necessary.- Be patient when inputting text.  If you were a PS3 user, you'll be used to pressing ""Start"" when done.  Well, now ""enter"" is actually R2.... I've accidentally erased a long text entry because I forget R2 is ""enter"", a few times now.  be patient!Goodluck and happy gaming,- MoistGamer

  great graphics and game selection and even more to come down the road.  wish they had included youtube with the online streaming services but I assume they will add that eventually.The menus are streamlined and easy to navigate and the controller is about even with the excellent xbox controller, which is a huge improvement from the dualshock 3.The game i have for the ps4 right now is battlefield 4 and the addition of 64 player maps to that game is something I've hoped for for a long time.  Cant wait to play the next MLB and Madden games when they come out for the PS4.

  This console is very good, Just like the Xbox one and yes I own both. Each console is set for each certain group of gamers. I have my Xbox one and play Ryse son of Rome while watching Impractical Jokers ( Loving the snap Feature ). But the Ps4 and more of a Hard core gaming console pushing that 1080p and a lot cheaper than the Xbox one.The Ps4 is worth getting because well the price is very cheap and that is good in this day age, And the graphics it can push out are Amazing and do not get me started on the Ps4 Camera. Overall its a good console and so is the Xbox one as well.The Xbox one is more of a laid back Gaming console, I never feel like im going hard at a game unlike when im playing Bf4 on my Ps4 and those 1080p Graphics are hitting me!.Anyways the point is, To me the Ps4 is for hard core gamers while the Xbox one is more of a laid back console that you will use for your daily life.

  I waited a few months before purchasing the PS4, hoping the price would come down a bit.  Then, I found one on Amazon from a 3rd party seller that had a ""Used, like new"" one for $440.  So, I decided to take the plunge.I had read the new dualshock4 controllers were larger, and I completely understand why - for my smaller female hands, the dualshock3 was a perfect fit, but I watched that controller disappear in the hands of some guys.  So, I was a bit apprehensive that these new 4 controllers would be too large for me.  Not so.  In fact - I find them quite comfortable.  I love the new touchpad as well.  Just takes a little getting used to.  Especially since I still play the PS3 games more often.The 4 boots up, connects to internet, PSN, Netflix and games load nearly instantly.  Love the WiFi feature as well!The only drawback that I can see thus far is there currently aren't a large # of titles available just yet for the PS4, but since I'm using it for movies, internet browsing as well as games, I still use it quite frequently.  I notice new games coming out frequently for the PS4, so I'm sure the library of titles will grow soon enough.My TV only supports 2 HDMI devices, so I had to decide which device to unhook - my cable box or my PS3, so I unhooked the cable box connection by just taking out that HDMI cable from the back of the TV.  Since I can watch movies on Netflix, and I still use my PS3 more than the PS4, it makes more sense at this stage.  I know many others are faced with this same dilemma - not enough HDMI ports on their TV's.  It's easy enough for me to reach behind the TV and change the HDMI cables out, but for those who don't have such easy access to the back of their TV's, it will be a harder decision.  I thought of moving my PS3 (or 4) to another room, but decided that having all the gaming in 1 room made more sense, for me anyway.Some may still want to wait until there are more titles available, or the price comes down a bit.  I don't think the PS3 is going anywhere anytime soon, so there is still plenty of time to make that decision.I'm very pleased with the PS4.  I like it's slim/sleek design, the ""standby"" feature - which allows you to charge your controllers but not have the unit ""on"" completely.  There is a software power control feature - which I think is nice as well.  As soon as you insert a disc - it powers on, then (from the menu) you can remove/eject a disc and either put it in stand-by mode or power the unit off completely.There are many new features I haven't even gotten into yet - facial recognition software, PS4 camera, bluetooth, etc.  But I look forward to utilizing all that the PS4 has to offer!

  I like this console way better than the PS3, its menus are a lot smoother and going to the playstore is even a lot better. Not a bunch of load times like it was on the PS3. Only problem that I have is the controllers battery life is not ass good as it should be and the lack of games but the games will come in due time. The graphics are better but not jaw dropping and the blu ray looks even better on this console. I like this console and if you are a gamer I highly recommend it.

  Like corporations that sincerely care about their consumers, Sony has done a stunning job with their Playstation 4 by learning from their mistakes and listening to their target audience (gamers). By doing thorough research on next-generation consoles, I now personally find Sony's intentions of making an amazing machine to be honest at heart. Apps like Netflix and Amazon prime work flawlessly and can be used with or without a Playstation PLUS membership (which, with free games and discounts is a great deal itself). Without a doubt I'd give the PS4 5 stars, but nothing is perfect. My only minor complain is the interface, which could use a bit of work. It's a tad cluttered into one section while the others are hardly ever touched. The system itself thought is incredibly powerful, and it is clear that they did all they could to make it so for its affordable price. Its design is beautiful, light, thin, and black throughout. It wobbles a bit when placed horizontally but trust me when I say this insignificant ""flaw"" (for lack of a better term) will not bother you. The controller is comfortable and intuitive and the games, though limited at launch, are stunningly beautiful in native 1080p and are only going to get better. Sony definitely delivered.

  Absolutely love it. Has been flawless so far since day 1 when I received it after I was 1 of the 1st to pre-order it as soon as I heard about it, It has a better design than my PS3 original curved top system. With the new update as of 5.1.14 its even better with share factory & the ability to turn DHCP off so you can record longer gameplay. I've always been a PlayStation kinda guy. It's a little better than the competitions system in memory speed only, it gets the job done fast, does everything a reg computer does, & is a little more geared towards games & not the entertainment center catch all. What's not too love

  Ps4 is a great system but it's not a must buy yet. There are great games to play but you can play them on the ps3 also, except for infamous second son. The system looks great, runs smooth, and it's very quiet. The controller feels much better in the hand, than previous PlayStation controllers. The light on the controller gets annoying after a while because it reflects Light on the screen, there is no way to turn the light off at the moment, maybe with an update that will become an option. I been playing MGSV, that runs super smooth and using the companion app works well together. Great system, not enough games, I still play my ps3 more than the ps4.

  While waiting for my PlayStation 4, I read into research of the many hardware failures that occurred around launch. So, I did go in with a little bit of panic, but after being told by Sony that they released a second generation of PS4s, I felt more at ease with the system, and come delivery day, I hooked up the console, did the mandatory updates, got my profile set up, and it works like a charm.The only major complaint I have is that there aren't many games out for it, which is normal for a standard console launch, but it's nothing I take points off for. I have my system out in the open and well ventilated, and if you have to ask if I'm a fanboy, the answer is no. I go with the console that suits my needs as a gamer, which I think the PS4 can do. The 1080p/60fps is a bonus incentive to have a PS4.If you're going to get a new console, not speaking as a fanboy, but as a gamer, go with Sony, because I can assure you from my experience that I've had no problems at all with the system, and it's worth the money, even if you wait until the holidays to get one.

I still have not received a good enough reason to get the camera. but overall it's a very sleek looking, smooth playing, machine. I bought this thing as soon as the pre order became possible. Thank You Amazon. There is a lot good features but until their store is more developed or they release more games they will go untapped. For the money your are getting an awesome game system/ dvd/ bluray/ 3d bluray hard to beat.

The UI is taking me a little time to get used to, but its pretty fast.Played Resogun once I got everything set up and that game is awesome.I feel like you have a lot more control over the features than the previous generation.Being able to choose to have my controller charged while in standby mode is a nice added feature.The footprint is smaller than my launch PS3, but I like that right out of the gate you get 500 GB storage, although I'll problably upgrade that to 1 TB in the future.It does seem to run a little hot, so make sure you put it in a well ventiilated area.

  Love the system.  Would have liked more than 2 usb ports for attaching controls/ect.  With only 2 it limits how many devices I can attach at once.  Also because the camera is proprietary and there is not an extension cable available it limits placement.  The 3D/picture quality, 7.1 sound and overall navigation is great. I would have given it 5 stars if the camera port was not proprietary.

  I purchased this PS4 in February 2017 and it died in August 2017. I'm very disappointed, I'm military and I was using this PS4 for entertainment with my colleagues whenever we had some down time.

  2/20/14I'm really pleased with the performance of the PS4 so far. I was really worried about the infamous blue-light of death I've heard many people talk about, but I've used the PS4 multiple times in the few hours I've had it, and it always responds well. I hope it continues to do so. The mechanics are great, but I've yet to experience the gaming greatness.I don't have any games for it so far. The only thing I've done so far is link my Amazon Video to it, but I intend on getting some games soon. My main interests are in Assassin's Creed Four and Battlefield Four. The latter is particularly exciting for me. I'm going to get PS Plus so I can play the multiplayer. The 64-man madness is something I've been anticipating for a while, and it is simply too good an opportunity to pass up. However, I am going to attempt to be patient and wait a little longer to get BF4 since I understand there are a lot of updates needed to make the game a better experience. So, I plan on getting started on Assassin's Creed in the meantime. I understand people are upset with the dearth supply of games, but it's been only three months since the launch. Building a diverse shelf will take some time, but I'm not really worried about it.Some great games are just around the corner. Watch Dogs is a game I anticipate when June arrives. Another game I'm really looking forward to is Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor. It does not have a release date yet, so I cannot honestly say this will come out any time soon. However, the AI for the game sounds fantastically challenging. Murdered Soul Suspect, Evolve, and Final Fantasy XV are all games I also really want to try. Another tentative yet awesome announcement is Red Dead Redemption 2 (or RDR three to those who've played Red Dead Revolver). I just recently learned it is being made, but I imagine it won't be released for another year. Anyway, these are just a few of my personal in-the-waiting favorites. I'm sure the PS4 will definitely grow a diverse selection of games.In the end, I am really looking forward to testing the PS4's full power. It's going to be an exciting new chapter for Playstation. I can't help but express my bias by giving this a five-star rating. I really enjoyed the Xbox 360, and I'm sure the Xbox One is also a great product. Yet, I wanted to stick to a platform I'm really familiar with, and the Playstation has been my life-long companion.2/22/14I've ordered Assassin's Creed Four and I anticipate it will arrive very soon. I've still only been able to use PS4 for simple things like Amazon Video and Crackle, but it's still handling well. It remains problem free, and I've explored most of the console's features.I like the continued use of the main task bar. I'm used to the theme-oriented backgrounds made available on the PS3, so the lack of customization and personalization is somewhat depressing. However, even if this isn't changed in the future, I'll be fine with it (although I suspect some changes will be made).I should mention to prospective buyers that you cannot add music from an MP3 player or CD to the PS4. I find this to be a significant loss. I had thought this sort of thing would transfer over to PS4 since it would reinforce the versatility of Playstation consoles, but I am hopeful this will change. According to an article on Eurogamer.net, this will likely be modified in the not-so distant future. I imagine other sort of personalizing features and apps will be added to the PS4 over time. If these are things you look for in a gaming console, you may not want to buy it right now.  The lack of UI customization is linked to Sony's primary efforts to create a platform oriented primarily for gaming, so we'll see what will become of the UI in the future.This is probably the most notable deficiency I've noticed for the PS4, but I still think the quality of the PS4 UI at this time is really good, even if it isn't entirely optimized. Overall, I am still very pleased with the PS4. I anticipate it will be a permanent item on my TV stand.3/01/14I got Assassin's Creed Four a few days ago, and I love it. The look and feel of it on the PS4 is nothing short of fantastic. The processing power of the Playstation Four really pulls out the minute graphic details and creates a smooth image. I really don't have much else to say until I've played it a bit more. I also decided to get BF4 given the price reduction and the player appreciation for the entire month of February. It is also runs well on the PS4 and looks absolutely stunning. Check out my review on it if you wish. The PS4 is still running well and I am extremely pleased with it. This is all really have to say for now.

  Only had this for a week after waiting for months to finally get one. The system is nice looking and stylish, has plenty of storage (500Gb) and is as you would expect a new system to be from Sony. The games are limited for now, but Assassin's Creed Black Flag is good and the graphics in Kill Zone are great! The only thing I noticed so far that I did not like was that it only seems to have HDMI out. I may be wrong, but I like the options that the PS3 had for outputs. Over all though this is a great system!

  The PS4 ahs the potential to be a truly great system.  The graphics are top notch at 60 fps and I really like the user interface.  A few things could be improved on the interface but that will come with time.  There aren't a ton of games out yet, but 5 star review is for the hardware/OS not the games.  The games will come with time.The new controller design is much better than the PS3 controller.  I feel like I can play FPS now on my Playstation.  I also prefer it over the new Xbox One controller.

  Overall, a very good system. Didn't run into any problems with setup. I was able to set up my PSN account, and Twitch account, and I was playing/streaming Killzone within a few minutes of powering on.Pros:- New, smoother interface- Can install games while playing others - also automatically starts installs disc games when you insert them- Can multitask a bit (going from a game to the main interface is now seamless, and you can browse the PSN store/music without quitting)- You can play game audio from headphones attached to the controller! (great for playing at night)- Super easy to setup streaming- Impressive graphics, especially Killzone, Resogun- The machine looks cool, especially the light bar- Controllers use a microUSB charging cable now, which are much more common nowadays thanks to Android phonesCons:- The Dualshock 4 battery life is about 1/3 of the Dualshock 3- The thumbsticks are really sticky/tacky and make my thumbs feel weird after playing for a while.- You can't use custom wallpaper, and for now there is only 1 themeThose are only minor issues, and I've only taken off 1 star for them. I am extremely happy with my purchase

  I ordered this a week before Christmas. It came just on time!! My boyfriend loved it and it seems to work fine. There was an issue with the Call of Duty game. The console freezes and has to be reset. I did not get this game from Amazon or this seller; but from my understanding it is a glitch in the game not the system. With other games and features it works just fine. Great investment to keep the boyfriend busy for me time.

  Worked well for about a month and then it started overheating. The PS4 does not work for more than a few minutes at a time. Since it is out of warranty and the return window is closed, I'm out of luck here. I have tried opening it up and blowing the dust out, that only slightly helped. It fails over and over. What a complete waste of money. I have since purchased a new unit under warranty from Best Buy. I wasted $200 trying to save a buck. I am 100% not satisfied with this order.

  Just a heads up, I own both this and the xbox one, along with the 360 and ps3.The system is slick, the visuals are great. Controller is still not as good as the xbox controller, but I do think they went in the right direction. It's a plus that they decided to keep an internal battery in the controller. I hope more games start to use the little touch pad but we'll see.Have had this system since launch and I was lucky to be one of the ones that did not have a disc drive problem. To be honest there hasn't been too many exclusives for this system. Second son was pretty good but I wouldn't consider it a system seller. But the few games that I have played have looked GREAT. I don't think there's much of a jump from ps3 to ps4 as there was from ps2 to ps3, but that should change once developers start trying to get everything they can out of the system.Price is very good at 400, one of the reasons I think its outselling the xbox one right now.If you plan on only getting one system the only thing I can tell you is that if you were a ps3 fan, go ahead and keep rolling with sony.

  The console worked perfectly when I first received and it kept working over the weekend. What I experienced while it was working was great. It was fast, I never had any issues with long downloading times - in fact, even though it is launch week, it was still faster then on the PS3 and XBOX 360. So even though there isn't many options for good games yet, I was still very pleased with it.But today when I tried to turn it on I had the blue flashing light and no audio or visual signal was reaching my tv. When I called playstation customer service, I did have to wait about 15 minutes on hold but the service agent was very polite and over all the customer service was excellent. I will be sending my PS4 in and they will be sending me a new one.So, over all, even though I did get the crappy blue light, when it works this is a great console.

  I've had my PS4 since Dec 10th now and all I can say is WOW.  The UI is on point and easy to navigate.  It only takes secound to jump from application to application unlike the PS3.  The graphics are great considering how early on it is into the PS4's life.  I cant wait to see what the games will look like 2-3 years down the road.  I'm super happy that I waited until I found one of these instead of giving up hope and jumping ship to xbone.  The new controller is also amazing and feels 10x better than the DS3.  If you're on the fence about the PS4 or the Xbone look no further!!

  Did not address the problem the PS4 have on the description,but gave a note stating that the eject button did not work well and had problem. Also the controller didn’t work that was not stated in the description even state that in the letter .This is not a great price for a great device. Sorry but worst experience I’ve had with this seller.

  Performs without any trouble, only downside at the moment are lack of games and lack of many features that existed in the previous generation, local audio\video playback, DLNA support, All of which might be fixed in the future with software updates.Getting PS Plus annually is highly recommended as starting from July 2014 it'll be two free games every month Guaranteed. SO you get 2 games for ~$5 a month.If you want to sweeten the deal throw in the new Vita bundle for $200, then you have PS4 remote play plus another 2 free games from plus.All in all a fantastic entertainment package. Very much satisfied

  Its a awesome review because I bought this because I had a Xbox one and the system was crap when it first came out so I traded it to a game store and waited till the ps4 was available and I got it as my birthday gift. Well worth the money plus psn membership was the better then Xbox live. Please don't think Im just a Sony fan boy but also a Microsoft and Nintendo fanboy but the 2 next gen TV consoles are not worth getting.

  Had one of Amazon's employees tell me that the warranty I got was for ""defects only"". My PS4 slim had a nasty fall and when I called Amazon, the representative was like, ""the extended warranty is for defects only"" and I was like, the warranty clearly said  accidental damage. We went back and forth and to no avail, I ended throwing the entire unit in the trash.

  I am very impressed with The PlayStation 4.  The controller is a great step forward from the Dualshock 3 and the console looks very slick.  The performance seems very impressive and the graphics look stunning.  My main problem with this console is that it is not compatible with games from previous generations of the PlayStation.  Big drawback for me because I would like to go back and play some of the classics.

  I purchased this refurbished “very good” PS4, and when it came in the mail it was physically beat up and damaged. Lots of scratches and dents. It also came with old accounts still active on the PS4, and was turning on by itself... it would also go into “rest mode” while I was in the middle of a game. I wouldn’t recommend purchasing. I will be returning this PS4

  Beautifully crafted, gorgeous OS, smooth transitions. This system is by far the best one made to date. The experience is worth it even to an avid xbox player. I highly recommend this console to anyone. The controller feels so light yet makes great contact with your hands. The triggers feel much nicer than previous versions and the digital joysticks have resistance to give you a lifelike feeling of pushing forward. The only downfall is the battery life of the controller, a little short for my liking.

  Wow... the PS4 to the PS3 was a night and day experience.  I have been very impressed in my short time owning this machine.  Not only ar the graphics way better, the gameplay, sound etc are great.  In addition you can exit a game to do other things like go to netflix, but the game is still ready to play.  It multitasks now. There are so many more things you can do with this game station, that I havent had the chance to try... very excited.

  The system is very nice! The UI is intuitive and incredibly easy to use. Its fluid and very fast. Its a MAJOR improvement on the XMB on the PS3. The game loads instantly and the mandatory download for a disc takes just a minute to install so you will be playing the game before you know it. I still notice some responsive delay on the store though but this could be fixed with an update. The video apps works really well although the keyboard on the apps (such as Amazon Instant) can be difficult to use. The system does make some noise upon start up but within 1 minute, quiets down and you won't hear a thing. The standby mode is well done as the controllers can be charged even though the system isn't on.

  Well for Sony's latest iteration of Playstation, seems they've decided to go back to the PS2 form factor of sleek jet-black and blue LED light. Very sleek looking console all around and not as big as you might imagine. Although a top-shelf PC outclasses it, PS4 is the most powerful gaming console on the market, and as we get closer to realism in our gaming graphics, I think the decision to use PC architecture and not use expensive parts (like PS3) did will pay off for Sony.Controller is much improved, I'm sure you can find in-dept analysis elsewhere, but it really feels great. Nice improvement to triggers, comfort, and most of the analogs. Little larger than DS3, but overall, not a single thing is lacking in comparison. Touchpad is useful as well, although I would have liked a larger surface to swipe along, it does it's job well enough.Now for what matters most--the Games! Infamous, Ground Zeroes, Final Fantasy 14 are my favorite games for the system so far, but be assured, if you aren't a ""hardcore"" gamer, PS4 is pretty awesome out of the box with PS+ and free titles to try out. Warframe being one of the better examples of the free-to-play model done right, and PS+ is filled with goodies already like Don't Starve, Towerfall Ascension, Resogun, and Mercenary Kings. Knack is also a nice old school title that's got that ""cheap"" hard factor to it, but brings a certain level of nostalgia that's hard to deny. Overall, it's one of the best launches I've ever been a part of. No stand out classic like N64 launch with Mario 64, but everything early on has been good to great, with Infamous topping the list in just over 5 months of PS4 being available. I really feel good about this one. Sony's marketing and messaging has been spot on with gamers, they are gathering indy guys up to the platform, and really, that's where a lot of amazing experiences is coming from. It really does feel like the Renaissance of gaming and developers going back to basics with old school designs, and fresh perspectives and stories.People get into game! There's stories out there like The Last of Us or Gone Home that are just as good as movies we spend $30 to see just once. Support this medium, check out games, and sit down with one for a few hours. This is no longer a children and ""geek"" hobby. Games are really beginning to reinvent themselves, with some truly touching stories that you feel more connected to since you are a ""player"" in that world. It's an entertainment industry unlike anything else, and short mobile games (while tons of fun) just don't give you the full spectrum of gaming. It's my favorite past time, even beating out reading, sports, and running. PS4 is a good well-rounded platform for any new comers looking into gaming.ProsPS+ You pay $50 a year (or cheaper if you can fine deals) and you get free games every month! The best value right now is still on PS3 (Over 150 games now) but it's great on PS4 as well and will get better. One of the best things Sony did this generation of gaming.Controller-Huge improvement and feels nice in handSoftware-Great catalog of games already when new systems usually are pretty sparse on content in the beginning. Infamous/Watchdogs/The Order/Dragon Age are my potential big hitters for this year, but honestly, I'm having a lot of fun with the smaller, more personal titles. It really is going back to basics.Community--PS4 quickly seems to be becoming the goto console for gamers. I think it may end up being this generation's ""Live"" where all your friends are on PS4, not Xbox, meaning community titles like Street Fighter or Call of Duty/Battlefield with have more active communities on PS4. We'll see, but so far, gamers are choosing PS4 as the machine of choice.Cons-OS (Operating system)  is barebones and not much customization is available-Many of the cool features like Pause/Resume, Controlling your friends game through the network, and PS now and Sony's IPTV which lets you stream games, movies/shows and Live TV are not available yet.-Best studio's titles are still a ways off (Gran Turismo, Uncharted, God of War, Little Big Planet) and Sony's is being very quite on what there in-house guys are doing. Likely won't be updated until E3.

  I was extremely happy to see Amazon still had this for sale given the fact that you can not find it in stores. My fear however was what kind of shape would it be in when it arrived. Thankfully it was well packaged and safe. The PS4 is much smaller when compared to the PS3, including the size of the box. I hoooked up it and it started up with no problems at all which was my next sigh of relief. Once I started setting up my account, which was very easy to do, I put in my first game. As soon as Metal Gear Solid V started up, it was just jaw dropping how life like it looked. I have a pair of ihome headphones and after changing the audio to work with them through the awesome dualshock controller, I felt like I was there, living the game.The UI is much better than PS3. It keeps track of what you last did, so instead of having to go find netflix after turning off the system, it was right there waiting for me as the first option. I love being able to see what my friends are doing now or what they may have accomplished in one of their games they're playing. It sort of has a twitter feel to it which is really cool.The speed at which it runs is very fast and very smooth. It had to download a few updates and it took less than 30 mins total, that includes updates for the games. As soon as you put the game in, the PS4 will start to install it to the system to make the games much smoother. It does not download them, do not be confused by that. You will need the disc to play the game, unless you buy digital.The library section is a great idea. Here it keeps track of everything you have downloaded, from apps to DLC for games. Once you download an app, the PS4 automatically installs it to the system. Something I don't think the PS3 did.The DS controller was really the next step. It feels much better in your hands than the DS3. The DS4 has an input for headphones, so you can play games or watch tv/video with out waking people. As I said earlier, when playing MGSV with my ihome headphones, I felt like I was in the game. Something that def gets lost through just playing sound through the tv. There is no longer a start button on the controller. Instead you have the touch pad, which acts as the pause button is some games. You also now have an options button and the share button. The share button is where you can record some of your gameplay and post it online for others to see what you did. So now when you brag about pulling of an amazing touchdown in Madden or go on an insane killing spree via COD or BF, you have the prove to not only show it, but boast about how awesome you really are.Given that this system is only about 6 months old being on the market, I don't believe Sony has even begun to get to the tip of the iceburg, this includes game studios as well. Plus still to come this year, which game studios and sites are claiming will really show off the power of the system, you have Watch Dogs, Destiny, The Order and the reason I purchased the PS4 in the first place, Batman Arkham Knight!All in all, this thing is amazing. It is worth every penny you would spend on it. If you are able to grab one, I highly recommend it.

  The PS4 looks cool, the controller is better, the Share function works great for sharing screen shots, video and live streaming to your Twitter and Facebook, etc. The games are amazing on my LG LED 42"" 1080p 120hz TV. It's very important that you have a TV capable of handling this awesome system (such as the LG that I mentioned). The PS4 only works via HDMI, so throw your Component chords out the window and step into the New Generation!  Additionally, LCD TV's just won't do IMO. You will not be able to see as much detail (that the developers have worked very hard on) in the games. The picture is much clearer with an LED TV or better.I also love the different colored lights that the new controller and system emmit when performing different functions. The built-in speaker and touch pad on the controller add a new, cool experience to the system as well. One game that I've played and love is ""Outlast"". Think... Resident Evil, in 1st person ON STEROIDS! This game is scary and will make you jump and I don't scare easily. It is like playing in one of the Saw Movies. I love the graphics and gameplay. I usually don't like 1st person games but I can honestly say that I would have bought the system JUST FOR THIS GAME ALONE. It is only available on P4 and PC.The only negative things I can say about the P4 at this point are that the cooling fan on the unit gets pretty loud after playing for awhile. Louder than my PS3. This is apparently normal though because the one on display at GameStop does the same thing.My other qualm I have is that there are not enough games for it yet (online or tangible). Virtually, no free games for PS + Member or incentives for P4 users at the moment. I know this will change soon. This is the same way the p3 was at launch.Lastly, the controller charging cable is rather short and it is different from the PS3 Comtroller cables. You can always go and purchase a charging docking station or longer chord if this is a super problem for you. Fully charged, the controller still gives you days of play time before needing to be charged again.

  Was thrilled to see the power was just a cord and not a brick. The system is self is slim and sleek.  The new OS is a bit more like Microsofts was... Otherwise I enjoy it and can't wait for more games. :).  Add me if you want. Xzchick!Oh, in comparison to the Xbox one? Physically it's more appealing by far. Slim, light, no brick, beautiful.  The one still has a power brick. A shiny one but still has one regardless... But hey every system has it's exclusives and I love both. I don't discriminate.

  A late arrival to the XBox 360, I got a gen 1 (and had the ""red ring of death). I then upgraded to the XBox 360s when it came out. With the new gen releases, I wanted to have access to ""the other titles"" so decided to go with the PS4.It arrived with protective air bags on 3 of 4 sides of shipping box. Other than this it unboxed, set up, ran, did the v1.5 and (later) the 1.51 updates without a problem. Played with the available system options and 2 games so far. Only had it for 2 days but it's run at least 6 hours or more; including Netflix streaming.Day 4: Massive session of Killzone yesterday. I have the dual DS4 controller bundle and had to swap out controllers to put the first one on the charger. No bobbles on game play or unit operations. Still pleased with everything except the lack of swappable battery packs on the controllers. Having some audio content come out from the controllers speakers added an interesting layer of play to the game. I wonder if the lack of dimmable LED light bars on the controler is leaching power that could otherwise be optimized if designers were given the ability to power it down if they don't need it.Overall, these are nits being picked in an otherwise great experience.No 1 star fail on this unit! YA!MORE TITLES!

  I had bought this online after visiting a few shops that had sold out.The price was great, free shipping plus no sales tax was a bonus that saved me a few bucks. I ordered on a Thursday, and on Monday the order still hadn't even been processed. However after chatting to customer support they said they would expedite it for me. These people next day airmailed it. WHAT? Anyways, the thrill and delight factor was definitely there.I had read that the box was flimsy. This is semi true. It is shipped in a pretty tight brown box. However inside the brown box were a few of those air pouches. Furthermore, the unit itself sits inside foam inserts so it is pretty safe.I also was concerned about the Blue light death streak. After a four hour game session, it was still good so I guess it's alright.Would definitely do business again, SO LONG AS THE ORDER IS ACTUALLY FULFILLED BY AMAZON.

  Ok, so Xbox fanboys will have a much different opinion, but this console is amazing. Graphics and speed are amazing. A boatload of games, and  Sony Is now previewing a cloud based gaming service that will allow you to stream PS3 games directly to this console. I am  in beta and it already works great... This is gonna be a game changer. This is the console gaming rig to have, no question about it.

  I love this thing. Great graphics, updates while sleeping. Also you can now charge you're controller while the ps4 is sleeping.Looks great, controller feels great. I don't understand why anyone would pay for an xbox one. This thing has more power, quieter, better graphics, it's cheaper, doesn't require you to have that stupid camera, and has an internal power supply.Only thing I would ask for is that we be able to change the background.

  I am a big fan of the PS3, so I was already swayed toward the PS4. So far I haven't seen any stuttering, tearing or lag of any kind while playing on it. It runs quietly and smoothly, looks awesome and is priced right!The Dualshock 4 controller feels better in my hand than the Dualshock 3. The battery life isn't as good as the Dualshock 3, but the better feel makes up for that to me. The included HDMI cable is a nice bonus and is appreciated.As far as I can tell, I am getting the same enjoyment and experience from my $399 PS4 as I was getting from my $1200 gaming PC. I don't miss it at all quite frankly! For the cost, it's an easy winner.This isn't a Playstation vs. XBox fight starter, but for the money I feel the PS4 is a better deal. I have had an XBox 360 and it was great. The XBox One looks nice, and I'm sure it's a great system also but I don't see it being a hundred bucks better! XD

  The product met my expectations, the packaging was very good, all the needed cables in place.I am not rating it 5 stars because the control pad had one button quite worn-out by heavy use, beyond what I expected for the description.This is no complain and I would recommend the store to anyone, just with a small warning.

  I was a little nervous after reading some of the Amazon reviews, but I have had no problems so far and have been using it since Christmas.  The graphics and physics when playing Need for Speed Rivals are absolutely incredible.  I don't have the PS3 and my last game system was the original XBOX, however, I have a high end PC to compare this to (Core i7) on which I play Test Drive 2 unlimited which I thought had pretty amazing graphics until I played Need for Speed Rivals on this.  The graphics and physics are so good on the PS4 it feels almost like real life or like your watching a movie you're in control of.People in the reviews have been raving about the sound, and given, I don't have this hooked up to any sort of high end sound system, but I play the music through pretty good headphones from the controller.  The sound is good, but I don't see how it is any different from what I am used to on a PC, it's nothing different that what I have been listening to for several years since games went to DVDs.PS+ : I am a little steamed that most games require PS+ to function and that it is $10 a month, which seems a little steep considering I just shelled out $400 for the system, which is considerably more than they sold the PS3 for.  This is the first time I've been willing to pay over $200 for a game system and now they want $10 a month too.  A little selfish by SONY if you ask me.  But on the positive side I found some free games, one called Warframe, that looks pretty cool.  They take forever to download and I have 20mbps internet.Microphone.  Some games have on-line chat, which frankly I find annoying and poorly done.  It interferes with the music quality when it comes on and most times all you hear is someone breathing into their microphone on the other end.  In Need for Speed it is hard to figure out how to turn it off and it seems you have to mute invidividual players separately.  Once I heard someone doing their dishes for about an hour in the background. I don't even know if my microphone is on or if others can hear me when playing.  I wish they'd disable this feature on the system or make it obvious how to turn it on or off.Overall this system is amazing.  Glad I purchased it and looking forward to more games that utilize the processing power of it in the futures.

  After a couple years, it has mainly just sat on the shelf. I recently read that they are now coming out with a ps4.5 which implies having upgraded hardware. It's disappointing that as a customer who bought this in the first month for the highest price isn't given anything for being a committed fan of playstation and sony products.

  I wasn't the first in line to get the PS4, and I missed a few times when Amazon got it in stock before Xmas. But just before Xmas, they got in extra stock, and I ordered it. Amazingly, without paying extra, I got it in time for the holiday (but since it was for me, it wasn't that big of a deal).First thing is that Amazon packed this in an oversized box, completely covered in packing material. This box could literally have been run over by the UPS truck and the PS4 survived. I was impressed.There are hundreds of reviews of this next generation console, so there's not much for me to add. The controller is very nice, but it took a few days to get used to new configurations (you can switch back to old configuration of the controller if you want). The home screen of the game is very cool with a soothing music playing in the background, which was fun.I immediately moved my Call of Duty:Ghosts from the PS3 to PS4 (I went digital) for $10, and started playing. The PS4 version of the game is light years ahead. The game play is almost exactly the same, but the graphics are incredible. In one map, there are hot embers falling from a fire, right into your field of view. Fog covers the ground in some maps. Dust swirls. Everything is more detailed, more realistic. The game loads faster and seems just speedier.When I first got the PS4, the Sony Playstation gaming headset would not work with the unit, though you could plug it into the controller with a wire. Not a great solution, but it worked. But a recent PS4 update now allows me to use Sony Playstation headsets wirelessly. So, this is no longer a issue, though I have no idea if other non-Sony headsets work.All that being said, there are a few issues that bring my review down to 4.5 stars, but I still round up:1. The included headset is just not worth the trouble. It is noisy, and of course, you still need sound of the game coming from your speakers. The headset is ONLY for communicating with teammates or giving verbal commands to the console. Others who are using the headset put a lot of background noise which forces you to mute people with bad mikes.2. The controller battery seems to last only part of a day.3. You have to buy a Playstation Plus subscription to use any multiplayer games. However, you get access to a lot of indie games for free (well, partially free, some force in-app purchases to get the better stuff).4. Some really cool games from the PS3 aren't playable. Yet.All in all, the PS4 is a great console, a serious worthwhile upgrade over the PS3. I haven't touched my PS3 since the switch, you can really tell it's the previous generation.

  I always used Sony and this system worked for about a good 2yrs and now for some reason  it doesn't work now in 2017. wouldn't have wasted money for a game system to just go out without taking abuse.

  1. HardwareAs it stands it is the most powerful 8th gen console. It plays games from 720p - 1080p in 30FPS - 60FPS. Games look a tad bit better than the PS3. 500GB of space, but you only get 407 GB in reality. The rest goes toward the OS I guess. I wish Sony given us 1TB instead especially since these games are so large. If you want to upgrade the HDD you can but I recommend waiting. A 4 TB 7200 RPM HDD will cost around 200$ and so will a 512 GB SSD. More space is nice, but for half the price of the system? I'll wait. And SDD's loads games quicker but not by much.2. Software/OSIt's many times faster than the PS3's OS. Pretty simple as well. That's it.3. ControllerMajor improvement over the PS3's. Bigger, concave thumbsticks, trigger R2 and L2 buttons. Light bar and touchpad are borderline unless in my opinion. The light bar more than the touchpad (unless you have the PS camera). Thumbsticks might be cheaper than the PS3's. Mines got torn up and I have to get a new blue dualshock 4 controller.4. GamesHad a slow start, but it's getting more games. It's getting more exclusives, playstation only exclusives and console exclusives. I don't want to list them, so I recommend going to wikipedia and searching a list of games on the PS4.5. AppsWe got more apps. Apps that weren't here at launch are here, such as YouTube. I'm not just, but if we don't have it, I would like funimation and crunchyroll.6. OnlineNow you have to pay for plus to play online. I think it's worth it. You get free games across three platforms monthly. They are quite impressive in my opinion. You ""lose"" these games when your membership expires, but you can either become a member again to play them or just buy them (most likely at a lower price). Look up PS Plus for more details.7. FeaturesShareplay allow you to share games, remote play allows you to stream your games, PS Now allows you to stream older games. Pretty neat features. And these are just a few.8. ValueThe parts was worth 381$ at launch and is priced at 400$ (you can get a free game as well). 400$ for this system seems fair.Overall enjoying my ps4 and looking forward to the Japanese exclusives (mainly RPGs and JRPGs). Have a PS3? I say keep it. Still games coming out for it and the PS4 isn't natively backwards compatibility.

  So far, I've had a stellar experience with the PS4. Maybe I'm just lucky, but I've had none of the launch issues yet. The graphics are clearly superior to the PS3 in every conceivable way. The user interface is not only much easier to navigate, but it also seamlessly transitions from one page to the next. However, every section can be accessed from the same page, rather than have to scroll through categories like you have to on the PS3. I also very much like the fact that you can simply scroll down on the main page to see what your friends are up to when they are logged onto PSN and you can share your activities as well. Another awesome addition is the ability to post screenshots and gameplay videos directly from the PS4 rather than need a program to do so. This is actually a very cool feature. So far, most of the public features can be tied to Facebook and/or Twitter, adding to the convenience of it all. The DS4 is also a definite upgrade from the DS3, but the specifics of that will be covered in a separate review.The PS4 itself is sleek looking. The product page picture is accurate, but when you actually have it sitting in front of you, it's even more impressive. It's both solidly built and attractive.Eject and power buttons on the console arent completely obvious, as they are touch vs actual buttons, and arent large enough to be very noticeable, but once you know where they are, you realize they are actually better that way as they are unobtrusive and unlikely to be accidentally pressed.So far, the only minor issue I've encountered is with the newest update, which I ended up needing to unplug and then replug it in order to get it to restart and accept the update. However, I had the same issue with my PS3, so it was clearly the update itself and not the system.Anyway, if you are a fan of the Playstation brand, you will definitely love the PS4. A definitely and obvious upgrade from the PS3, as well it should be.

  Just like the PS2 and PS3, this generation beats its competitors in exclusives and better hardware. I like the Xbox One controller more, but the PS4 controller is an improvement over the PS3 DualShock controller. I own both new consoles with this getting the slight nod over the Microsoft device.

  I've been a fan of the Sony Playstation(s) since the first one came out sometime in the late 90's... 1998, 1999?The Playstations become more and more of a computer with each new iteration. The PS4 continues that trend.The initial lineup of games were a bit underwhelming, but it gave fans of certain genres something to play. Indie games are a big focus of the PS4's draw. There are many good indie games that can be found on the PSN. Speaking of PSN, getting a Playstation Plus membership ($50) is essential to getting everything you can out of the console. Unlike the PS3, you need a PS+ membership to play games competitively over the internet.You also get free games every month for being a member of PS+. Keep in mind that these free games become unplayable if and when you decide to forgo the renewal of your membership.The Dualshock controller that is included with the console is the best/most comfortable controller yet. Everything about the controller is very intuitive. The only part of the controller that is severely underutilized is the touch pad in the center of it... I guess developers will think of creative ways of incorporating that into future titles.The one drawback that I noticed so far, compared from its predecessor is that you cannot load videos onto the console... i always liked that you could load mp4 film clips onto it, but not with the PS4... and I'm not even talking movies here, i'm talking videos you take with your phone that you would like to load into the system... nothing... sadness. Thank God for Chromecast... that's another review for another time.Overally, i'm quite pleased with the PS4... I purchased the console, Battlefield 4, a PS+ membership, and a Turtle Beach wireless headset... the only complaint I have is that it lacks some more good software... I miss the good old days where new consoles came with a franchise game (SNES + Super Mario World, Genesis + Sonic, N64 + Mario 64, etc...) I would have love to have seen a new Crash Bandicoot, or Gran Turismo, or even a nice JRPG from Sony... instead, we got games that are made annually... NBA, NFL, COD, BF, etc... not that i'm complaining.... but then, I guess I am. Sigh...I guess with Watch Dogs coming out soon, I have something to look forward to...Overall, I'm very happy with the PS4... especially since I also have a Vita and remote play is a nice touch... but nothing beats online multiplayer... >: )  ....except a nice engrossing role playing game with a great story. :)

  i have a ps3 and love playing on it, but the ps4 is just a better machine. faster processing of everything, from startup, to loading up games, to the menu and switching between applications. the only thing the ps4 falls short on as compared to the ps3 is the ability to see local media servers like plex or ums. other than that, i see myself using the ps4 more and more vs the ps3.

  Its great but seems a little sub par UI Wise (User Interface).Multiple things I miss that was on Xbox Live.Some examples...1.After playing a game there is no slide with recent opponents therefore you cannot say GG (Good Game), give them tips on how to improve or my favorate which is rage message them if they play cheap. If you think someones a beast you have no slide to click his/her name, you must write it down on paper and send a request after game.2.No Stick Figure Avatars, I miss dressing up my little dude previewing parties seeing him next to my friends avatars. On PS4 your avatar is like a profile picture. *Yawn boring.3.No Backgrounds!!! C'mon son seriously people say it doesn't make much of a difference but it does. After having the PS4 for two weeks it becomes mind blowing and remember I previously had Xbox 360 which let me make the back ground whatever I wanted.4.As of now no YouTube App yea I know we all have it on Mobile devices but still the PS3 has it and the cheapest Cell Phones have it this Console costs $400 it should have the Youtube App.5.You must purchase music... Seriously??? No thank you PSN why cant we insert USB's and play/save music from those like we use to? I Hope Sony doesn't profit off this ignorant move.6.Doesn't show when friends come online, go offline and were last online. This is a pure Head-shot.Iv'e talked to some friends and read reviews on PSN+. PS3 it was free now they charge $50/year RIGHT? So I'm thinking ""Man they're probably going to upgrade the online"" NOPE its still the same, this is something I couldn't determine myself because I had Xbox BUT its what PS3 owners told me.When the Xbox One gets a price cut (and you're not forced to get the Kinect) I'll pick it up and pass this down to a loved one.NOT because its bad, I'm just spoiled from all the UI features from Xbox Live. 4.5 Stars

  First and foremost my condolences to those that received DOAs. You are all in my prayers.I'm extremely satisfied thus far with the PS4. Everything from the PlayStation Store to UI looks clean and operates seamlessly. Anyone coming from a PS3 can most certainly agree with that statement. I love the fact that I can hit the PS home button and change settings such has audio levels without having to quit the game. The DS4 controller feels so much better and has improved greatly compared to the DS3. The only downside is that the battery dies much quicker than the DS3. The wired microphone that came with the system works surprisingly really well. When I'm in a party chat with my friends I can hear them clearly with no static or issues. The selection of games available for now is weak which is expected, but they can keep you entertained until more games become available in the coming months. Games such as Battlefield 4 look and perform beautifully so I can only imagine what future games especially exclusives will have to offer.In conclusion, this is a major upgrade coming from a PS3. Anyone on the same boat as me can agree. This is a great investment for those that are true avid gamers.

  My PS4 is my best friend, I use it for everything entertainment wise, from playing video games to streaming movies and television shows. Graphics are really sharp on it, but it would be nice if had a larger hard drive, but I know I can upgrade when I want, at least. Good solid entertainment console. I can't just call this one a gaming console as it does so much more.

  TL:DR: This is the definitive console for this generation, but it could be better. If you're not set on buying a PS4 right this instant, I'd wait for a Slim model.Comparisons to the Xbox One abound on the Internet, so I'm going to just list my own pros and cons. Hope this helps you.Pros:-- Compatibility with a wide variety of devices and peripherals:The PS4 is compatible with a number of different, third-party accessories and devices via USB and Bluetooth, and the Dualshock's audio out jack is a standard 3.5mm jack compatible with any stereo headphone (which is a godsend when compared to the Xbox One). This is great because it does not shoehorn you into purchasing overpriced ""gamer"" peripherals (Astro, Turtle Beach, etc) or poor-quality first-person addons like the Xbox One Chat Adaptor. My personal setup uses a Blue Snowball iCE USB Mic and a pair of V-Moda XS stereo headphones, and I plan to pair it with my Bluetooth keyboard.--Functional Party Chat:Party chat on Xbox One is well-known for functioning poorly, dropping party members or failing to connect party members at random. The PS4's party chat just works. Plain and simple.--SpotifyThe PS4 just recently partnered with Spotify, and the app hit as of last night. This is a killer app for me, as it allows me to play my own music while I play games. Nothing on Xbox One comes close to this.However, the PS4 could be improved in a couple of areas, at least in terms of hardware...---Not enough USB portsSo, I'm a gadget guy. I like being able to hook up various gadgets to my devices. So I'm somewhat disappointed with the shortage of USB ports on the PS4. With a USB mic using up one port and the Dualshock's charger cable using up the other half the time, I find myself wishing I had one or two more USB ports for a USB stick or a headphone amp (more on that in a second).---Subpar audio out of the Dualshock audio port and lack of a separate mic in portI know that maybe I'm expecting too much out of the Dualshock, but I feel like the audio out of the stereo headphone port is somewhat lacking. Comparing this to the audio from my speakers, I can't help but think that either the wireless connection between the Dualshock and the PS4 isn't sufficient to support good-quality audio, or the port isn't outputting enough power to properly drive my headphones. In addition, I wish there was a separate mic jack so I could use an Antlion ModMic.---No analog output (stereo or RCA) for audioI know that this probably won't affect many people, but I do wish that the PS4 supported analog audio output via RCA or even just a 1/8"" stereo jack. I've seen a number of people online become frustrated trying to hook their PS4s to older PC monitors without headphone jacks. Personally, I'm using old computer speakers on my PS4, and it would have been nice to be able to plug the speakers directly into the PS4 instead of my monitor. In addition, since I primarily play wearing stereo headphones, I would have liked RCA compatibility so I could hook these up to a powered headphone amp. Instead, the only audio options we have are HDMI, TOSLINK optical, or Bluetooth wireless.

  Typically, I like to purchase delicate electronics from a local store versus having them shipped, but as no one had a PS4 in stock, I ordered through Amazon. The unit was packed very well and luckily there was no shipping damage to the unit. I've always been a big Sony game console fan, and the PS4 doesn't disappoint. I tend to wait longer for new consoles because of the lack of games, but there are enough PS4 games currently out to male the purchase worthwhile.

  I bought this for our sons, 14 and 17, who are very good, sweet boys who earned this PS4 by doing lots of chores, including digging their mom a french drain for her kitchen gray water.We have had every version of the Playstation console since the first one came out, when our older kids were young. I honestly didn't think there would be that much of an improvement over PS3 and, considering the recent investment in PS3 games, I was reluctant to purchase a new console. However, the graphics, load time, and functionality really are a step up from the PS3. And I say that as a mostly idle observer who rarely uses the PS4 for anything except accessing my Plex server. The kids are definitely thrilled with the PS4 whenever they can wrench the controller from their father's grasp.As far as issues, there haven't been any. With all the prior Playstation incarnations their have been occasional glitches, overheating, and hanging games--which I admit back in the day was probably from us soldering and modding them. We didn't mod the PS3, but it still had a habit of hanging. So far this console has run as smooth as butter. As the first stop for tech support and complaints in the house I really appreciate that stability.If you are thinking about getting this for your kids, and balking at the prospect of a subscription to Playstation Plus, I did too. I felt like, between the cost of the console and games, I had already laid out enough money. However, my husband needed it to play Destiny so he bought it and I found out that you can  download some pretty neat free games and games that aren't available on disk, and you can get discounts on games you buy through the Plus service. It is one of the few subscriptions I haven't ultimately regretted and actually has added value to the PS4.

  I bought two of these!  BOTH systems are running great, they are NOT loud (some people are reporting that the fan is very loud, but personally I have not experienced this except at startup for about 2 seconds, which is NORMAL, your PC probably does the same thing), they are running flawlessly, and on the first two days, between me, my friends, and my son, each of them probably ran about 36 hours STRAIGHT!  There WERE a few problems with PSN being over-utilized and having some issues (more people logging on than the servers could handle), but that's fixed and everything is AWESOME!!!!!!  I love these systems, will buy another for my girlfriend for x-mas.  So far, we have played and beaten Knack, COD Ghosts, Killzone Shadowfall, and Contrast (couldn't really get into Warframe (would be great as a single player campaign, BUT that's not available, only online multiplayer).  I like the old PS3 XMB UI over the new UI, but that doesn't take away from the FUNCTION of the system.  The voice commands work good, but took my 12 year old a little while to learn how to command it correctly, you have to tell it step by step how to do something (Playstation...Knack.....Start; instead he was trying Playstation...start Knack, and it wouldn't work).  The playroom is cool as hell, for about 3 minutes, then it will probably never get used again other than to show your friends or family.  The face detection is flawless, it automatically logs in whoever is in front of it at startup, you can change the login later if someone else wants to play (more than one person can be logged in at a time),  All in all I AM VERY HAPPY with the PS4(s), everyone I know is happy with them who have bought them, and none of us have had any failures yet (other than the PSN being down for a little here and there in the beginning, but that's not the PS4 itself)!  Its a beautiful system, and works flawlessly, you will not be disappointed with this addition to your living room!  (And you CAN verify that I actually purchased these in my histories on Amazon)

  Review in ProgressThis is my first time buying a launch Sony system since the PS2. System is working fine and I'm enjoying my time with the system.  There were some weird glitches on the UI on the first two days, but it appears that it was due to the PSN connection issues during launch. I would hold back on purchasing if you are afraid that you may get a faulty system (Please see all of the 1 star reviews). If you don't mind taking the risk of having to send the system back to Sony I would fully recommend getting one for yourself. It'll be interesting to compare the PS4 launch to the Xbox One to see which has the smoothest launch.This review is ongoing, it may change.. Hopefully my system won't brick anytime soon.3 Stars during 11/15/134 1/2 Starts on 11/19/13Pros:Great Graphics; I'm finding the detail in AC4 to be truly immersive and it's adding a lot to my overall experience.Social: The social aspect of the system is quite fun. It's interesting to watch live streams of other players around the world..It should be better in the future with more a better variety of games and when the system is out in Japan.Cons:Controller battery lasts only 4-6 game play hours; depending on how much a game uses the rumble feature.Current Game library: I know this is typical of a new game system launch.

  I bought this 45 mins after the launch.  I'm really impressed with the console.  Most know the Specs etc. Last gen consoles I've owned 2 ps3s and 3 xbox 360s.  I only ever used the ps3 for Blu Rays since xbox had more games that I was interested in.  With this generation I choose the PS4 due to it being $100 cheaper than the XOne.  I'm an old school gamer and have no desire to use the Kinect or any other movement device so why pay for something I'm not going to use.  PS4 was targeted at the gamer where as the XOne is trying to cover all entertainment aspects.  Don't get me wrong I do have my system linked with my digital library and other apps, but I still use it mainly for gaming.  Another thing that turned me off from XOne is the stunt they pulled over the summer saying about being on at least once every 24hrs or their used game policy, then doing an about face when the gaming community spoke up about it.  I wasn't that swayed by the about face so I decided I'll go with the PS4 for this generation.  I may end up getting the XOne eventually if they sell it without the kinect and it's the same price as the PS4.  But it will probably be about 2-3 yrs before making the plunge for that system if I do it at all.  As of now I love this system enough that I will be buying 3 more for my kids and living area.As far as the shipping of the item.  As others stated the PS4 was put in the bottom of the box and the packing material was put on top of the console.  Shame on Amazon's shipping department for not putting in packing material then the console.  UPS is not gentle in their delivery methods as I've had occasionally had box come banged up or tore up on the side.  I will give credit to Amazon that if there is ever a damaged, lost item they will quickly resolve the issue.

  I've had the oppurtunity to play in depth on both and I love the way playstation goes about there interface much better. Also downloading and playing the 4-5 gigs or so at the begginning of a game work better on the ps4 games compared to the xbox one; Also ryze took me like a day and a half to download on xbox but all the ps4 games I've bought only took like 6 hours max

  I have been using my new PS4 for a few weeks now and I am happy. Nothing I can say that has not been posted a million times over. The one point I WILL make is to make sure you remember, (I didn't) that you can only play PS4 discs, and Blu Ray's. None of your digital games will work unless they have been upgraded. So buy a game when you get your console yes? Have fun!

  I was surprised at how small it actually was. The interface is slick, smooth and responsive. I have mine connected via hardline so the lack of 5GHz wireless-n is not that big a deal for me but might affect others in wireless heavy environments. Playstation Plus is a must to take advantage of everything this thing has to offer but the free games that are given away make it well worth the investment.

  With the anticipation of FF7 Remake, I broke down and made the choice of purchasing the PS4 as a gift to myself and I have no regrets spending the money. It's a beautiful system and very sleek design. I'm loving it so far. I recommend purchasing the additional warranty plan. For the price you're paying for the system, it's nice to have the extra warranty protection.

  I own both Xbox One and PS4, and PS4 is just funner IMO. The games look better, run better, and load quicker compared to X1. Xbox one is still a very playable console though. But if you're looking for the best system to play multiplatform titles on, this is the one to get. It's $100 cheaper and runs games better. Compare some multiplatform games on X1 and PS4 and the PS4 version always is superior. Usually with a higher framerate and resolution.The controller is great. I hated the dual shock 3. This controller is a huge improvement over the dual shock 3. I find that the xbox one thumb sticks are a little too small to use optimally. They are nickel sized. These sticks are a little smaller than a quarter and have a much nicer tactile feel to them. The dual shock 4 also finally has serviceable triggers.There really isn't much to play on either system at the moment, but thats usually the case with every new system launch. X1 probably has the better exclusives as of early 2014, but PS4 plays the multiplatform games better. PlayStation Plus is a much better value than Xbox live Gold, tooIf you can only afford one system, get the PS4. I currently play my Ouya more than my xbox one. All my multiplatform games, I play on PS4. X1 has some exclusives but they are all probably mid 7.0 out of 10 games. They aren't worth dropping half a grand on a system for.

  I have had the PS4 for a month now and find it the most advanced gaming console out there. The controller is extremely user friendly and comfortable to hold, esp. for long periods of time. The graphics are incredible and take advantage of the full 1080p HD television's capabilities. I like the speaker in the controller; it is a way to get you really into the game. I have a plus account for my PS3 and it was a little confusing in the adaption to the PS4. I had to call Sony support and they walked me through the process. It took less than 5 minutes. There was no waiting when contacting Sony support and the reps were most helpful. I replaced the 500gb hard drive with a 1.5tb hard drive in no time. Sony made this process quick and easy. I was able to buy this unit for the MSRP of 399.99 when Amazon opened a window of purchase at that price with free shipping. I wasn't going to buy it until the price came down to 399.99 but I got lucky and hit Amazon just as they opened that price window. There is no way I would pay more than the MSRP for the PS4 so you should either wait until you can get this for the MSRP or keep checking Amazon to see if they open a price window. As of this writing, Amazon has opened the window and you can get it for the 399.99 price. The most important thing that Sony can do, though, is to download an update making the unit DLNA compliant. I would be able to integrate my systems with the PS4 and not have to use my PS3 for this process. I am also looking forward to more system updates to include other features not on the PS4 such as backward compatibility.

  Main review here:As I note below, I'm very, very, very happy with the purchase of my Sony PlayStation 4.  I have been greatly enjoying the gaming that I've done on it so far (over the first week since its release).  Understand though, that despite my happiness with the system, there are some areas that need to be and hopefully will be improved in the not so distant future:* Bluetooth support for headsets (third party and/or Sony manufactured)* The release of a media remote control, either third party or Sony's own.  With the lack of support for PS3 peripheral usage, there was no way to use the existing PS3 Blu-ray remote control with the PS4 :-( and < mad smiley! >-- note to above, there is a third party media remote control due to be released at the end of December 2013 that should help in this area, but it adds a slight negative in that in order to use it, you must place a USB dongle into service that will mean losing the use of one of the available USB ports on your PS4* Sony's continued lack of support for IR remote controls.  As with the PS3, Sony insisted on NOT building in InfraRed remote control support, so the use of IR remote controls, especially useful for those with fancy 'universal' remote controls (such as the Harmony series) are left in the cold again.  I would have hoped that Sony learned their lesson about this with the previous generation, but no such luck.* No 3D Blu-ray playback at release of the system.  That should be resolved in the future, but it is yet another reminder that to some extent Sony (and Microsoft, who had the same limitation on their Xbox One platform at release) rushed to put out release date hardware that is not feature complete at the time they put it out on the market.* No MP3 or CD playback at release of the system.  Not that I intended to be using this device for such playback, but some people would and/or did with the PS3 and that is a drawback to the system until it is corrected.* No DLNA support at release of the system.  Yet again, hopefully fixed in the not too distant future, but lacking at release of the system.* The Blu-ray drive is a slot-loading drive that sits in the system in a manner that some might find confusing based on the way the system is assembled.  The drive sits to the left front of the device, partly under the shiny black plastic cover, and partly under the more matte plastic area, with the eject button and power button on the systems lined up over a portion of the drive slot rather than being completely to the left or right of the drive slot as one might expect.  This seems to have been a case of Sony being too smart for their own good in trying to hide or minimize the thought of using the drive.  While the future may be digital distribution of content, the drive in this device is likely to be used over and over again and hiding it shouldn't have taken precedence.  It should have been easy to find, as should have been the power button and eject buttons.* Speaking of which, yeah, the power button and eject buttons are easy to see, yet not so easily identified as to which button does what.  There are markings on the button for power that are there, but awfully small and not so easily seen.  There is no reason anyone should have to consult a cheat sheet or user guide as to what button does what and yet Sony has put the system together in a manner that doesn't really cooperate in that area.* At least initially there seems to be no way within the system configuration to turn off or mute the microphone that is built-in to the PlayStation 4 camera -- except for plugging in a separate headset/microphone that would have to have its own mute button on it.Things that I like about the system:* Less expensive than it's competition, even with the addition of the very nice PlayStation 4 camera (which I do recommend)* The controllers have a nice feel to them.  In the initial release of the last generation of PlayStation (PS3), the original controllers (Sixaxis controllers) were too light for my tastes and just didn't feel that comfortable for my taste.  I really like the feel of the DualShock 4 controllers, and the weight that they have.  I don't want them to be too heavy, but don't want them so light weight that I can't tell that I have one in hand (which was my problem with the Sixaxis controllers for the PS3)* Setup is pretty simple.  'nuff said in that area really.* The new interface is pretty slick and easy to navigate through.Neutral for me, but probably negative for others:* The need to have a PlayStation Network (PSN) membership for many gaming features.  On the PS3 the need to have an active PlayStation Network account (membership, fee based) was minimal.  Not so with the PS4.  Sony has basically copied their competition here and pretty much requires PSN membership which brings a yearly fee with it.  It is (to me, and to many others) worth the fee, but others might complain and so I note that issue here.How are the games?At the time of release, the games are good, but still a bit rough around the edges.  We are obviously at the start of the next generation in console gaming (at the time I'm writing this review).  A few years out we'll be (hopefully) seeing games that truly push the limits of the next-gen hardware, and we'll see the PS4 and Xbox One systems doing things that truly impress us, at least for a few years.  Eventually these/those systems are going to be 'old' and 'long in the tooth' and we'll be pining for the next next-generation to come along, but for now, the games that we're getting, well, they are pretty nice even if they aren't overly impressive.Graphics in some of the release day games are good, mildly impressive, but just not where we all expect they'll wind up being.  It really is a matter of the developers learning how to do things on these new devices.Games I like:  Call of Duty: Ghosts.  First person shooter that looks pretty nice and plays well.  Later we'll look back at that game as being one that seems so crude by comparison to later releases in that franchise. :-p  Knack.  Knack has proven to be a lot more fun than I had expected.  Very Crash Bandicoot-ish.  Easy to play (at least on the 'easy mode' that I prefer for now) and yet still a lot of fun.  Battlefield 4.  An alternative to CoD: Ghosts.  Assassin's Creed.  Beautiful game, looking forward to playing through it completely.  Lego: Marvel Super Heroes.  Just a ton of fun, especially for younger audiences.  Madden 25 is OK for a football/sports game fix, but isn't necessarily something that I'd recommend buying.  It is nice, but it continues to have issues that nag me too much to spend money buying it.End rating: 5 stars.  Note that I might also give the Xbox One 5 stars if I were rating it, but I'd be doing so more from my love of the systems as I expect them to be, rather than as they are right now.  Neither are perfect, both will eventually improve, and both should continue to push the other to be better for all of us to enjoy.History lesson follows:I'm very, very happy with my purchase of the Sony Playstation 4, though I must admit that when I made the pre-order I was really not sure that I'd be able to come back and say that.Let me start by saying that in the previous generation, I was very much a fan of the Playstation 4's main competition, the Xbox 360  I liked the Xbox 360 an awful lot.  To the point of 'when you can pry it from my cold dead hands'.  Despite multiple issues along the way, mostly the notorious red-ring-of-death that was experienced by most early adopters of the Xbox 360, I still very much loved that system.  Why?  Xbox Live primarily.  It was head and shoulders above anything that anyone else could offer.  The ability to quickly and easily socialize with other gamers that you were playing with or against took console video gaming to the next level.  In FPS (first-person-shooters) this was great because you could plan team maneuvers in the games, while in more social (arcade type) games you could sit and socialize with old friends or new that you happen to make from your travels (as an example, I wound up making several friends by sitting and playing the Xbox Live Arcade version of Uno for many thousands of games).I owned a PS3, a couple of them in fact, but I really only ever used them as media players.  Blu-ray players primarily.  Gaming on them just didn't feel as comfortable to me.  My friends were gaming on Xbox Live, and I wanted to be there with them.  The games seemed nicer/better on the Xbox 360 (though normally it would be a draw as to which system had the better version of any one game).  The whole experience just seemed nicer on the 360, so my PS3's sat lonely most of the time.Years later, when the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 were announced I followed the news anxiously, looking for reasons to choose one platform over the other, and I fretted over which system was going to be the right one for me.  I wanted to stay with the Xbox line, but was leery of rumors of new features and/or new ways of installing and use the software on the system enough that I held back waiting for the official announcements of what was coming.  Once those announcements hit, I found myself unable to place any faith in Microsoft that what they were promising was not going to be incredibly harmful to myself and to other gamers.  The ability to trade in old software, sell off used games, and other similar things was going to be gone, or severely limited and restricted in ways that I just couldn't support.  A day or two later, Sony announced what they'd be doing with the PlayStation 4 and at that point, they were instantly the gamers best friends.  No restrictions on selling or trading away disc-based copies of games.  Yay!  Other seemingly draconian restrictions that Microsoft had talked about were also non-existent in the Sony world.  Double Yay.  I quickly placed a pre-order for a Launch Edition (Release date) PS4 system here and then waited impatiently for it to be released.Over the course of the next very volatile few days, Microsoft took a beating in the court of public opinion.  They wound up back-tracking on almost all of the new paradigm they had promised (some would say threatened).  In the end, they pretty much offered up a continuation of what they had done previously, but for me, and many others it seems, it was too little too late.  While I could still have placed an order for an Xbox One system, I had cast my die and my seething and hatred of what Microsoft had said they were going to do couldn't be quelled so easily.Here, (at the time I'm writing this), months later, both systems have been released, and I've been enjoying the use of my PS4 for the first week of it's life.  After installing the requisite launch day patch, there's since been one other firmware upgrade.  There are still features that aren't quite working yet, but should in the future, and certainly patches that will continue to come.  The competition between both major parties will ensure that continues to be the case.End of history lesson.

  Okay, I am a big fan of the PS3 and just had to get the PS4 for launch day.  With all the promised games coming, I am glad I did.  I love the new interface and the new touchpad SixAxis controller.  It took a bit to get used to it, but it's nearly second nature now.  I just wish there were more games released rather than just having a few to select from.  Patience patience... But still worth buying one if your thinking of it.

  I was one of those unlucky customers that had a defective blue ring of death system. Of course it was frustrating hooking it up on Christmas and not having it work, but I knew I would be able to get it fixed in no time so I called sony and told them the problem and a few days later they sent me a box to mail it back in. The estimated repair and return time was like 2 and 1/2 weeks, but I actually got it 3 days after I sent it. I was unsure if they even fixed it. I figured maybe I was missing some paper work or a service number or something but to my surprise it was fixed and working perfectly. I've been playing it non stop. I'm happy with the graphics and some of the features. I've only played assassins creed so far because most of the games I want to play aren't out yet. But at any rate. I'm happy.

  Wow, what an amazing experience!  I spent the entire weekend playing Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag and I loved every minute of it.  My only regret is that I have to go back to work today.  First impression:  Must Buy!I did have some problems with the 1.50 systems update.  I was EXTREMELY frustrated as the PSN kicked me off 3 times (after an hour of downloading each time).  Just before I threw the new system through my television set, I calmed my head and went to my computer.  Took about 5 minutes to download the patch onto a USB and another 5 to upload to the PS4.  If only I had thought to do that in the first place...Anyway, it was love at first sight, and the rest is history.

  It runs more efficiently and smoothly than its predecessor PlayStation 3. Design is top-notch, it looks great; release model is already slim and its not loud at all. XMB interface is familiar but definitely updated.The PlayStation Store leaves me wanting more. I expected my digital games bought on the PS3 to be available for use on the PS4, but no such luck. Maybe someday, but as of right now its pretty much completely different stores for PS3 and PS4 consoles.

  While got in a decent time, when my boyfriend unpacked and installed the system, he had multiple issues trying to get the game to show on all tv's. He tried it on his tv, my tv, and the rest of the tv's in his house with little luck. He could only get it to pop up a few times since the purchase. The product however came with all the pieces with minimal damages and scratches. Will be expecting a refund for the money I spent.

  Ok so I'll add my little bit to the discussion as well regarding my launch PS4. Overall, I'm happy with my purchase. The PS4 was delivered by UPS and the shipping box was damaged pretty badly, fortunately the PS4 box itself had no issues and it was very well packed. I plugged the unit into my TV and waited for the day 1 patch to download. First thing I noticed was how much FASTER the PS4 downloads versus the PS3. It wasn't long before I went thru and did the initial setup. Upon turning it on and signing into the PS network, I noticed that the home screen was clean and simple to navigate, although I can see down the road it looking like my Kindle fire screen and taking forever to scroll thru once games, music and movies start to load up on the PS4. Hopefully they fix this with an update later. I had two games, Killzone and Battlefield. Battlefield looked good, but wasn't what I was expecting for a next gen game, it was better than the current gen consoles, but only marginally. Killzone looked very impressive and I expected so as it was a nex gen game from the get go and not developed alongside current gen versions. Unfortunately, I have Satelllite internet and limited allowance so I haven't been able to enjoy any multiplayer. Word of caution for anyone downloading demo's via satellite. THe demo's appear to be huge. I couldn't find anthing saying the size of the download and I downloaded EA NBA 2014, figuring it'd be a gig or so......it drained the remaining 10 gigs I had remaining for my allotment, so be aware the demos are huge downloads. Appearance wise, it blends much better into my entertainment area than I was expecting it too, but I try not to touch it too much.....like my original PS3, it's a fingerprint magnet. I will say, Battlefield and Killzone, while they looked great, it was apparent the PS4 was not being taxed to play, so that bodes well that as good as these games looked now, they will get much, much better as developers learn to utilize the power. The PS4 controller is much improved over the PS3 dualshock, but I gotta say the first thing I did was turned off the controller microphone. This may hinder some gameplay when listening to videos within the game. I played audiologs I found in Killzone and never heard anything, and I assume this is why. The light on the controller, while being a great nuisance to my wife when she's trying to sleep, doesn't seem to do much more than run the battery down faster. The touchpad seems nice so far, and was fairly well utilized in Killzone where it became second nature to use really quick, actually much quicker than I anticipated it would. I can honestly say I think I will see an upgrade of the harddrive, just playing Killzone and Battlefield, the mandatory installs take up a LOT of space, so 500 gigs won't go very far when the games start rolling in. Feel like I'll be in the same boat I was in with my 60 gig PS3 and having to delete things to make room for other things.All in all, I'm glad I got it, I'm passing on the Xbox One for now, will wait for it to come down in price and after the reliability has improved. For my PS3, I had one die on me and replaced by Sony. My Xbox 360 (original unit) I had die 7 times and recieved another unit which has lasted so far, but I rarely play it as I bought the newer black Xbox 360 and it has worked fine. I think they'll both be great boxes for everyone and hopefully they both survive as it is the competition between them that will give us great gaming for a long time to come.

  Sony did not disappoint with the newest console...I love pretty much everything about it, but if one thing stands out, it's the major improvement of the controller. It is a vast improvement on the Dual Shock 3. The light is a bit weird, but I understand it has a purpose, as it can be used something like the PS move controller in some applications. Otherwise, the controller is pretty much perfect. The console itself is amazing, looks sleek, it's powerful, and quiet. The next gen games look great, and they will just get better as the developers gain more experience with the new system. Sure, it could use some more games, and features (I'd like to see 3D Blu-ray, for example), but such is the price of being an early adopter, have to be patient. But I think it's fun to ""grow"" with the console, and it's upcoming updates, and features, improvements, etc... The only other thing I'll add is, based on previous history/consoles, Sony tends to make the highest quality hardware on the firstversions, which is why I wanted to get in early.  Think about the first (fat) PS3, compared to the latest version...same thing with the PSP, and now, the PS Vita. In all those cases, the original consoles were traditionally the best built, then, in later versions, Sony tends to cut build costs (and quality, in my opinion).

  This system is the best value for money right now if you are a gamer. The console is the most technicallly capable console, yet it only cost $399 (still expensive, but cheaper than a gaming PC and other comparable gaming consoles). Also with a PS Plus subscription you get access to free games, many of which are actually worth playing. Some cons to the system are that gaming is pretty much all it does. Gaming and Media streaming apps such as Netflix, Hulu, etc. It can play blurays, but I don't think it can play audio cds at this time (which is strange and hopefully will be  added soon). I recommend the system if you primary purpose for buying it is to play games.

  I love the new system to play games because the graphixs are amazing, bluray movies look just as nice. The ps4s new controller feels quite nice in my hands over the ps3 controller.Dont be fooled the new console is flawed by my standard the ps3 has the ability to play movies /video files from a flashdrive the ps4 wont identify that there is a gig stick plugged into the console.To make things worst I was expecting many of the games on the psnetwork to run on the ps4 but not just yet.Overall I am very happy with my purchase but if it wasn't for the games due out soon with the better graphix of next gen technology I would have waited 1 year to buy the system.I do for see many great updates for the ps4 in the future but having to wait is not fun.

  I am a long time Xbox gamer and decided to take the plunge and switch over to the other side for this generations cycle.  I've had this console for only a week, but am already pretty impressed with it.  The games look great and probably will look much better as developers focus on the next gen and learn all the tricks.  The user interface is much simpler than the Windows 8-like Metro interface used by Microsoft products.  The current capabilities of this system, as well s the Xbox One, have not caught up with the last generation with regard to media use and some other features, but they will come in time or they wont matter to most gamers.  The PS+ services is decent and fairly easy to use, though I suspect it will become harder to find what you want as it gets more crowded with games.  I've only used the online service to paly War Thunders, and everything ran well with no lag or issues.  No one was using microphones, so I cant comment on in game chat.  I suspect Sony's on-line environment may need some time to catch up to what Xbox Live had to offer.I was a bit surprised that I could hear the variable speed cooling fan from time to time, but with an internal power supply, it's expected that more aggressive cooling is required.  The Xbox360 and Xbox One both have very large and unwieldy external power bricks, probably to minimize heat buildup in the console itself.  Bear in mind, I have never owned any Sony gaming platform before, so I can't comment on how the PS4 ompares to PS2/3 etc.  But I can say I am enjoying it and looking forward to enjoying it for a few years to come.

  Ps4 has a lack of games at the moment, but they are on the way. I received my Ps4 on launch day and have had no problems so far. The UI was a little problematic at first, but updates have helped a lot.  Call of Duty, Battlefield and 99% of all other EA software I will not buy. I like to spend my money on things that I fill have some kind of quality. With that being said I got Killzone. Campaign is dull and boring compared to Killzone 2 and 3, but it does look very very good on the screen. Multiplayer is exceptional and if you liked other Killzone games you'll probably like the multiplayer more than the campaign. Just my opinion.  The controller is better, BUT!!! The battery life is only about 6 hours, so have a spare controller ready if you intend on playing for any length of time.

  My ps4 arrived June 4 and i ordered it June 1 when i first got it i hoped my console wasn't DOA (Dead on arrival) and it wasn't. when i UN boxed it i looked and i saw a special offers card it came with 3 codes worth of 10$ and i entered them in and they did not work. i looked at the card and it said they expires 3/31/14 and that told me my ps4 was a launch day console . i called Sony and they told me to call the retailers i got the console from which is amazon i called amazon told them about the codes and they refunded me 30$ dollars that problem was solved. my next concern is my controller the first couple of days it was working fine and then my battery was down so i plugged in the charger and the controller didn't charge but it was on and if i unplugged it. it will go dead in seconds so it was acting like a wired controller basically i called  Sony again they emailed me a receipt so i can print it and package it with the controller  but my console was a launch day so by my controller being broken its been sitting in the shelf for more than 6 months and the battery cant hold the so yea other than that the ps4 is awesome i never had problems with the console i rate this 5 stars because if i hadn't received a Launch day console i wouldn't have these problems and i recommend buying this console just from a store near you so you can get quick refund but if you do wanna buy from amazon i recommend buying a 2nd controller just in case you don't have to en counter the problem i had . i hope you found this review helpful

  The PS4 itself is pretty sweet.  Boots up way faster than the PS3.  Takes a while to get everything up and running to include all the latest software downloads and installs.  The absolute best upgrade from PS3 is the font type and size.  I always had to sit close to the TV to read anything because the font was so tiny.  With the PS4, I can sit 10-12 feet away and read information on the screen easily.  The PS4 also has additional apps at the ready for video/music and can run streaming apps such as Hulu, Amazon, and Netflix.  This makes it a great all-around entertainment system.  I'll leave all the techno-babble to others.  Odds are, if you're reading this, you know all the specs already.Pros:Very easy and user-friendly walk-through to set up PS4 to include connection to internetBoots up very quicklyFont type/size fixedEasier lay-out/less sub-menus than PS3Useful initial start-up manual/instructionsDon't need to have PlayStation Plus membership to run apps like Netflix (unlike XBox)Controller is bigger and more wrist-friendlyPS4 is more powerful than XBox One (remains to be seen if games will take full advantage)Cons:Confusing to know if you've quit an application or it's still running in the backgroundReally pushy about connecting to Facebook and/or Twitter (read carefully during initial start-up)Very limited selection of games (not really the hardware's fault, but something to consider for now)

  I actually prefer my PS3 Super Slim as it is more silent and runs a lot cooler. Surprise Surprise but in terms of the latest generation of game consoles, the PS4 is like my Mazda 3. Plenty available, they sell okay, they're solidly built and is very fun/entertaining.

  I have not stopped playing this thing since day one.  I've played several games across different genres, like: Infamous, Watch Dogs, Assassin's Creed, The Last of Us Remastered, Need For Speed Rivals, Killzone Shadow Fall, Wolfenstein: The New Order and a few others.  The graphics are always top notch and performance is never an issue.  frame rates are smooth and fluid unless the game code itself is the issue (I'm looking at you pre-patched Infamous).  The menu system, while similar to the PS3, is still improved a lot.  The Playstation store is roughly the same, but I must say, PS-plus games for the PS4 have been somewhat lacking.  There are no AAA titles yet, just independent titles (most of which are retro themed) and free to play MMOG's.  The new PS4 controller is awesome in itself with the addition of sound and the center trackpad. The controller usually plays in-game audio for things like voice recorders and special effects, like the rattle of shaking a spray paint can or shake light.Since we all know nothing in life is perfect, I'll list the cons:* Extremely tiny power and eject buttons furthered hampered by a design that makes it hard to find them or the USB ports.  I keep the PS4 on an entertainment system shelf about knee high.  Due to the all black color and slimness of the console, it is very difficult to see the slot for the disc as well as the buttons and USB ports.  I always need to use a flashlight to insert a disc or plug in a USB cable.  I've memorized the location of the power and eject buttons, so they're not as bad.* The fan can get loud at times* I've run into crashing issues where the system would freeze and the only way to resolve it was to do a hard-reset by holding the power button for 15 seconds.  I think it's related to Infamous in some manner because as long as Infamous isn't installed, the issue completely disappears.* The controller gives very insufficient warning when the battery is exhausted.  I've been in the middle of several games only to see a warning message about the battery pop up onscreen and then the controller abruptly stop working immediately afterward.  I mean like a minute or less.  I feel it should at least give the warning a minimum of 30 minutes before the controller stops working.  That at least gives you a chance to finish a section or at least properly save your game without the need to plug it in to do so.  It's very awkward for me to use the controller while plugged in, so I must go wireless.So far, the benefits far outweigh the cons of the PS4 and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it in a heartbeat.  With great upcoming games like Destiny and Evolve, the future is only getting brighter.  I also see top mainstream titles eventually making their way into the PS4 PS+ monthly free games lineup.  For this reason, I wouldn't purchase any launch titles or anything released over six months ago unless you get an impossible to resist deal.  I think a few launch or older titles will end up in the free games queue very soon.

  The PS4 is awesome! It shipped very quickly (took about three days to arrive). I couldn't tell it was a used system. It had very, very small scratches on the glossy finish on top but that didn't bother me any. The console is fast, very quiet when operating, excellent graphics. Just wish I owned a bigger TV to enjoy the video quality on the PS4

  It's been a great upgrade so far. System menus are clean and fast, and with the new update I can use my PS3 headset. CoD and battlefield where definitely worth the PS3-PS4 conversion. Assassins Creed looks very nice on the PS4, but if you've beaten the PS3 version and don't play multiplayer, it's not worth an upgrade. Looking forward to more games being released later in the year.

  I purchased this at launch but since everything was brand new I wanted to give it a good bit of time before writing a review.  Overall I'm very happy with the system.  I never owned a PS3 - I had a 360.  It wasn't a console war thing I just don't have the time or space for more than one system.  I was happy with the 360 but when looking at the next gen I made the switch when I really started getting into my Vita and PS+.  I'm really happy with my choice.  The console and graphics are amazing, the performance has been fluid and the controller feels good to me and is laid out well.  Once I finally got all the settings and tweaking correct (both with the systems and my WiFi) the remote play with the Vita is awesome.  The future looks good with all the games I'm seeing previews for so I really have no regrets.  Shame I can't play some of the PS3 games I have from PS+ on this but since it's truly next gen I understand.I am starting to have issues with the controller however.  The rubber pad on the left stick has torn along the bottom edge.  My R1 button is starting to stick as well when I press it from the right side.  It's starting to become a problem when playing certain games so I need to call Sony about it.  I kinda want to dock a star for this (the controller, especially with only 1, is pretty key) but we'll see how Sony handles my request for a repair.  When the controller was new and with everything else considered this console has delivered for me.

  I'm not going to review hardware specs.  That has been done in detail elsewhere much better than I could hope to do.  Instead, I'm going to report on what matters to me as a user - the end user experience.First, the user interface is greatly improved.  It still has a version of the media Xbar at its heart, a row of icons that each lead to sub menus related to general categories, but it has been streamlined a bit.  It still isn't perfect.  Trophies, for example has its own category on this bar, but trophies are also found as a subcategory in the profile menu.  Friends, messages, and chat are also separate categories with single functions, which I think could have been condensed into a submenu for social functions.  At the same time, settings has about 20 sub menus, each of which sometimes has other sub menus embedded with them.  Some items are curiously place, such as downloads and uploads being in Notifications.Nitpicks aside, it's a clean interface and generally more intuitive to use than the PS3's.Greatly improved are the game and application sections.  Instead of each general category being an icon on the main media crossbar, these are in a separate horizontal bar underneath the main one, organized by which apps you've used most recently.  Highlighting a particular icon enlarges it and bringsup a sub menu, and pressing down from the main icon brings up an overview of related information such as game manuals, links to web sites, trophy information, and so forth along with PSN store information related to the app such as add ons.  It's much more user friendly than the PS3 media crossbar.One function I particularly like is the Library.  Once you sign in to your account, anything you've bought in the past, but isn't currently installed on your system is found here.  The first time I booted up my system, I found two games I had on my PS3 that were cross-buy items and were ready to download.  It would also make storage management easier; if your hard drive is nearly full, and you need to clear some room to install a new game, anything deleted will be added to your library to make it easier to download later on if you decide you want to have another go.Another is a small addition to the trophies.  In addition to the name, type, and description of the trophy is a rarity rating that tells you exactly how many people who've played the game have gotten a certain trophy.  I actually find this much more useful than the bronze/silver/gold/platinum system.  It's fun to see exactly what percentage of players have gotten a given trophy, and it even tracks this information for any PS3 games you've played.Gameplay has been greatly improved.  Every game needs to be installed but this is done automatically in the background, and the game can be started once a certain portion of the game has been installed, with the rest installing in the background as you play.All in all, the end user experience is greatly improved.I said no hardware review, but I have to talk about the controller.  In most ways, it's vastly superior to the PS3's, though still not quite as good as the nearly perfect Xbox 360, still my favorite controller of all time.  It's slightly bigger and weightier, feeling more solid in the hands.  The thumb sticks are more widely spaced, eliminating thumbs bumping into each other when moving left while looking or firing right.  They are have more resistance, which feels nice.  The triggers are greatly improved, making them the default choice for aiming and shooting in games rather than the less than ideal bumpers.  The track pad so far feels like more of a gimmick than anything else, as I've found thumb sticks to work better for anything the track pad can do.Battery life isn't very good.  The 1000mah battery lasts around 7-8 hours between charges, which makes sense when you consider the light bar, dual rumble motors, track pad, light, speaker, and voice commands through the headphone jack are all on and drawing power whenever the controller is on.On the negative, there's no support for MP3s or DLNA.  I get why Sony did this.  Sony is one of the world's largest distributors of music and movies.  MP3s don't have any DRM, so pirated music could easily be played with MP3 support.  DLNA enables media streaming from a PC to the device, making it possible for streaming of copyrighted movies or videos under some circumstances.  I get it, but I still think it hurts people who bought their media legitimately more than it does hackers and pirates, who are more likely to find a way around these anti-piracy measures.  Or just use another device - I stream my MP3s directly to my receiver anyway.That said, even as a big fan of the Xbox 360, I find the user experience on the PS4 to be the best I've ever had with a game console.  Sony listened to the criticisms of the PS3 and improved on nearly every aspect of the user experience.  While some features are curiously missing - pausing game downloads, themes, MP3 support - it's still early in the console's expected 10-year lifespan.Oh, and the games look . . . well,while noticeably better than last gen games, the difference isn't phenomenal, the way it has been  with some previous generations.

  After months of the PS4 being out of stock everywhere (went to so many stores and looked online) I finally was able to get one! Shipped really fast got it in only in a few days. Only thing I dislike is it is a tad noisy.Other than that this is an amazing system very happy! Also very happy I didn't go with the Xboxone!

  Not just graphically, but the XMB on this console is leagues better than the one that plagued the PS3 for choppy and awkward navigation of the menu. I own the XB1 and PS4 and have to say the PS4 is ahead in terms of smoothness and intuitive layout for the operating system, the direct opposite of last gen. Just need some good games to finally play.

  What is the PS4 like after you have had a week to let the new console excitement wear off?  Good.  Not great but good.Pros:The Look - The PS4 looks great.  Some people don't like the lights on it but I do.  I think it's makes the console stand out from previous consoles.Hardware - I haven't run into any lag, frame rate issues, slow load times, or slow download times.  So far it seems like they really used top notch hardware.Controller - The controller is good. I wish the trigger buttons were larger and I wish the options and share buttons were a little larger but other than that it's a great improvement over the old Dualshocks.Software - Right now it's average but still a plus.  I liked the layout of the PS3 better.  I don't doubt for a minute that the overlays and menus are going to change overtime.  It also seems like Sony is taking a ""wait and see"" approach.  The software seems a little shallow right now but you can tell it could easily be expanded.  One big plus right now is the enhancement of the trophies.  Now trophies tell you what percentage of players have obtained them and, if it's a PS4 game, you can see how rare the trophy is.Cons:Missing Options - There are some things that really need to be adjusted. For instance if you plug in the PS4 camera you cannot turn it off without unplugging it.  There are a couple of other things like this that can get annoying.Sharing - This needs work.  I find myself sharing stuff because of accidental button presses.  Also you need to be careful and narrow down what you share or you'll virtually spam your friends with junk. I want to see more options too.  I haven't been able to figure out how to upload to YouTube from the PS4.  I also want some good editing options.  If I'm going to share I want to share something I'd want to watch, not a simple screen shot or video capture.PS Plus - This is on here because it's driving me nuts.  I am a PS Plus member.  The store doesn't seem to know that.  When I go into the PS Plus section it tries to get me to buy a membership.  I end up looking at what is included into Plus, going to the other sections of store, hunting down the item, and then it seems to figure out that I'm a Plus member. Granted this should be fixed soon but it's odd that it's busted in the first place.My guess is within a year or two the PS4 is going to be a 5 star product.  Right now it has a lot of potential.  Let's keep our fingers crossed and hope Sony doesn't screw it up somehow.

  First, let me start off by saying that I'm am a very hardcore Xbox 360 fan; However, I still own a PS3 and now the PS4. I decided to pre-order this console over the Xbox One console this past summer because Microsoft came up with bright idea that they should limit or pretty much eliminate buyer/player freedom over games; new only, no used or reused games on their beloved next-gen console ( they soon changed that). So anyway, I pre-ordered this console from Amazon.com and I received it 11/18/13. After I read several negative reviews from this website, I wondered if I made a wrong decision...the answer is not at all.The console itself is pretty light weight compared to the original PS3; the design is sleek and innovative. The set up was simple and easy, I think it was set up to the TV in about 5 minutes. This was met with some reserve because I was waiting for the ""blue light of death"" to appear and it didn't...I was ecstatic. So then I began to set up my user account and if you have a PS3, then you can connect to the same account. I accidentally set my PS4 under another name so I have two Playstation accounts. So, getting set up was pretty simple and I like the new menu interface over the older PS3 crossbar media interface, this one seems to be set up more like the Xbox Live interface without being Live. As an added bonus Playstation includes a code to redeem 1 month of free Playstation Plus (required for PS4). So I began to play Madden 25 (a must have) and I noticed the graphics were second to none, better than 360...really. The character animations made me think I was looking at a real live NFL game on TV. So after playing Madden 25, NBA 2K 14 and Assassins Creed IV Black Flag, I was thoroughly convinced that this system was an excellent choice for me. The one thing I have to get used to is the controller; I really like the dual shock 4 controller over it's predecessor the dual shock 3. It's larger and wider, the handles have better grip for sweaty hands, I also think the dual shock 4 is more comfortable in the players hands (much lighter), it's not heavy like the Xbox 360 controller...good controller but heavier.Overall, I can't compare this console to it's direct competition (Xbox One) yet because I haven't had the pleasure of purchasing one thus far; but compared to the PS3, Sony has done a wonderful job of not repeating the mistakes of the PS3 console at launch. If your a hardcore gamer like myself you will probably buy both consoles in due time, I will. The Sony Playstation 4 console comes highly recommended from me; one thing I think is an edge over the Xbox One is that PS4 has a removable 500 GB HD and the One does not. This is important to know because the PS4 games require a lot of HD space, for example NBA 2k 14 uses about 50 GB of Hard Drive space, which is a lot for one game.To sum it all up, which ever system you decide to buy, I don't think you'll be disappointed especially with the PS4. Thank you for your time.

  The PS4 works beautifully! there are a few scuff marks but other than that it is working as intended. Sadly it was packaged with a faulty controller and had to buy another, seemed like a problem that woulda been easily spotted with a test of any kind. Thanks for your business!

  It's clear by now who won the next gen war and its Sony. With Xbox One's frequently in overstock, it's ridiculous sign-in requirements, being made to buy ""points"" you don't need just to purchase a DLC or game, and the whole constant can fiasco at launch its clear who won the race.This is an exceptional machine (own 3) that has NEVER ONCE given me issues (had two one month after launch). I only spend the amount I want to spend on DLC, games, etc. I can chose to not utilize Plus and simply play offline, I'm rewarded with frequent credit to my PSN store account for being a loyal customer and their support (my hubby used once when he couldn't figure out a feature and refused to listen to me lol) is outstanding and there's none of the banning stuff you get from Xbox crybabies.But Microsoft has exclusives! What? They revamp Halo every year. Big deal. I've played GoW and I find nothing about it so mind blowing that I'd put up with all the crap that comes with owning a One. TitanFall? That hype came and went pretty fast. Just trust me. I still have my working Atari Pro Series. I've played or owned almost every console released in America. This is your best gaming bet if you're a hardcore gamer who wants serious flexibility, options, graphics and a company that stands behind its customers and rewards them regularly.

  I love my PS4! You can't go wrong with Sony and the games WILL keep coming. I have had this for a few years now with no problem and it works just as well as day 1. Now that the Pro is out if you have a 4k TV go with that, or maybe even the slim for better form factor.

  Mine works great.  I've used it quite a bit over the first week and left it on for hours at a time, it never has gotten hotter then warm to the touch and hasn't crashed or had any problems.  Looking at the number of 1-star reviews compared to the number of units amazon moved, even if less then half of the people with failed units have written a review the failure rate would still be less then 1% as Sony indicated.  The Xbox failure rate seems to be about the same,  neither system is having the major problems some people want to believe.The system is very fast and responsive.  The lag of doing everything on the PS3 always bothered me, now everything feels instant.  All downloads and updates are now in the background automatically and don't interrupt your use.  The new layout is simple and easy to use, you don't have to scroll through hundreds of options to do anything like on the PS3.  The new controller is great, they fixed the things I hated about the old one by fixing the triggers and analog sticks.  I was really happy they removed the camera, I have no interest in motion controls.  The launch lineup is a little weak, but there's plenty of great games coming in 2014.  Getting Resogun and Contrast for free was nice.  Resogun really is surprisingly great.  You pretty much have to get PS plus now, however I've had it for years with my PS3 and the number of free games I've gotten out of it is incredible.  It's so worth it, especially if you also have a PS3 (or Vita).  Sony periodically has sales / credit back deals so whenever there's a discount I buy a year of PS+ then it stacks onto your current account.

  The Playstation 4 is an investment in entertainment that I know will pay off. The history of every Sony console proves this. The Playstation 4 came out of the gate at a price point of $400, a full $100 cheaper than its closest competition.The hardware itself is inline with many mid-powered PC's out there (Minus the GDDR5 RAM). With a majority of the resources running games and not a robust Operating System like Windows, this gives even more power and flexibility.The Playstation Store offers hundreds of games. If you want to play online, you need a PS Plus account. At 60$, it may sound steep, but it is a great deal. You gain access to discounts on nearly everything in the store, early access to BETA's, FREE games every month for all of the Sony Consoles (PSP, PS Vita, PS3).What is great about the new store, is that you have the option to download either single or multiplayer first. This allows you to get in and play sooner.The console can be laid flay or stood vertically. There is bit of a wobble issue if you press the rear left down when flat, but it is so minor and you have to look for it it is hardly worth mentioning.The console itself is thin and quiet. There is no power brick either. Surprisingly the console stays cool, even after long periods of play.There are only two USB ports in the front, which I use for controllers.A drawback for some is the lack of any Video out other than HDMI. So if your TV does not have and HDMI, you are SOL. My brother had to buy a new TV.The controller is solid and feels natural. The tough pad is underused right now, but the stereo built in has been used in some interesting ways.The user interface seems basic and simple. You now where everything is without being to cluttered.If you buy the separate Playstation Camera, you can utilize a free game/demo that comes bundled with the system. As of now, it is useless unless you plan on recording yourself play.That leads me to one of the most interesting features. The ability to live stream your gameplay for others to view. This has created a community full of people, games, and talk shows that surprised me. Some are lame, some are pretty cool.The PS4 is a solid system that has focused on games and the community revolving around games. No hidden surprises or limitation. There a new found confidence that I feel is lacking from competition (And this is coming from a fan of other consoles).

  Since i have had the PS4 I have not encountered any problems with it . Set up was as easy as can be and its great that a HDMI cable was finally included in the box. In terms of performance the system is fantastic. Going from game to xmb and back is remarkably quick and the system runs just as quietly as the PS3 slim. Overall Im very pleased with my purchase, the only thing I would suggest is upgrading the capacity of the hard drive if you can because 500 gigabytes will not be sufficient as game installs are quite large.

  I did what most people who buy a product that works do; used the product and never really looked back.  That's probably why there are less positive reviews for the Playstation 4 than you'd expect.There are a ton of reviews on the web already, so I'll try and keep this one short.Pros -Great hardware, best of this new generation under the hood.  8 GB of GDDR5 RAM and an easy architecture for developers to work with.  Xbox One's 8 GB of DDR3 are close, but not quite.  We've already seen some multiplatform games take advantage of this and that will only continue as the generation goes on.  First party titles will benefit even more, and Sony has some great studios under contract.Excellent controller with a built in battery for recharging.  Improved L2 and R2 shoulder buttons and analog sticks.  Comfortable.Streaming works well and is very easy to do.  You either log into your account or make one, then hit the share button and start broadcasting. That's it.User Interface is clean and intuitive.  Switching between applications is wonderfully fast.Warframe, a free-to-play that is really ""free to play"".Cons -Battery life for the controller is maybe 8 hours, and it takes two hours to fully recharge.  You can play while the controller is charging of course, but the charging wire is short.Several features of the console aren't available at launch.  mp3 support, dlna support(streaming), bluetooth support for various headsets,  These are all getting patched in later, but if you really enjoy those you might want to wait for confirmation of exactly when they're coming.If you're not gung-ho about FPS games, the majority of ""system sellers"" don't apply to you.  Battlefield 4, Killzone: Shadow Fall, Call of Duty: Ghosts,  With that said, there really aren't any launch day exclusives that match the hype of Xbox One's Killer Instinct, Dead Rising 3, or Forza 5.  Warframe is awesome and Resogun is fun, but they are not necessarily ""system sellers"".

  So far so good.  Originally, I thought I had the HDMI issue, but it turned out to be my receiver.I'm using a Denon AVR-1611 Receiver, and I'm using HDMI from the PS4 to my receiver, and HDMI from my receiver to the TV.  At first, I was getting a flashing screen, that would go to from a clear picture to a snowy/staticy screen when I started my PS4 from Standby OR if I turned my TV off, then on, and left the PS4 running while I was away.  When I would turn the TV on and wake the PS4, the screen would blink on and off with the issue I had described above.When I plugged the PS4 directly into my TV, it worked fine w/o any problems, so I was able to determine it was an issue with my receiver.  I was able to change to a different HDMI port on the receiver, and I tweaked some of the input settings in my receiver configuration, and now the PS4 works without any issues at all.I am giving this a rating of 4, because the menu system is very confusing and non-intuitive.  Many of the system settings that were on the PS3 either are in a completely different menu on the PS4, or are absent.  I'm sure in later firmware updates, this will be managed, but for the launch of the system, I wish it would have been a little easier to set up.The graphics on both games that I bought with the system are amazing--it's definitely an enormous upgrade from the PS3.  I can hardly imagine what games will look like in 5 years if the launch titles are already looking this good.  As many other people have said, the controller is really awesome.  I am a fan of the DS3, but the DS4 is much more comfortable, and I really think the improvements add to the usability and feel of the controller.I highly recommend this system to people who are first adopters and like games like Killzone and Super Stardust HD.  If you need a lot of games at launch, you may want to wait until the library expands before you make a purchase, but overall the system is really good.

  Great product. Any one who is looking for the gift for that 6-10 year old boy or girl who loves games this is a good option. I bought a small tv for 80$ and this and my son loves it. Its his to play Minecraft and mine for when I want to game online. Plays blue rays and regular DVDs.

  I received the PS4 quickly and set it up.  Man is the PS4 AWESOME!  The graphics are beyond comparison and I cant wait to Play MLB the show on it.  If you are a gamer, go ahead and get it!  I was pleased to be able to get here on Amazon because I couldnt find it anywhere else locally.

  My 13 year old nephew saved for 6 months to buy this game console. I dont know who to talk to about this but the delivery driver left it on the porch, after 9pm, without so much as a knock on the door. It could have been stolen or rained on.

  I was a lucky one I guess.Slight delay due to holidays, but it did arrive well padded with bubble wrap.  Boots up fast, superb graphics.  Controller feels fantastic, much improved over my PS3 controllers, in fact I had no idea how much I would hate going back to the PS3's controllers after playing some BF4 with the new ones.I think the first batch from Amazon had some poor packaging management.  I wouldn't hesitate to order now.

  I got a PS4 slim. I wanted the original PS4 cuz I liked it better. It works fine, but it’s only 500 gb. For the same price, you could get this with double the storage or with the same storage but with uncharted 4. If I’d known this, I would’ve gotten a PS4 Pro

  unlike its xbox counterpart. the ps4 is my personal favorite, with a easy interface, backround downloader, and soon to be wide varitey or games coming out for it, exclusive or not, i feel the ps4 is the route to go! also being a member of PSN, i get a free game every month. cant shake a stick at that.as for this product, i received it in an undamaged box. the sp4 had no problems installing, and the controller works 5/5. very very very pleased with this investment.

  This is the first console I've owned since the SNES in 1994. I was primarily a PC gamer, which has been difficult since I run Linux as my PC OS by choice. Fortunately Humble Bundle came along and made Linux gaming a lot better... Unfortunately that seems to have merely stoked the fire and left me wanting more.When WATCH_DOGS was announced, I really, really wanted to play it... I will not buy Microsoft products, so I decided to buy a PS4, rationalizing that its Netflix & other media streaming capabilities could replace my aging Logitech Revue Google TV box and that perhaps I could play some multiplayer games with my wife... And of course I could now play some of the latest games in all their HD glory on my 42"" LCD HDTV that I use as a computer monitor.I bought the PS4 and achieved Platinum on Need for Speed Rivals & WATCH_DOGS in short order. I've got about a dozen games now which I've been playing a lot; I even got my wife to play some. We're looking into maybe getting her a PS4 of her own so she can do online multiplayer with me since there aren't many ""couch"" mode multiplayer titles that interest her. I've lost a lot of sleep playing well into the night. So many good games have been released and are coming out; I wish I had more time to Platinum them all! I've met a lot of good people (and some jerks) on PSN, which has been mostly fun. I got RockSmith 2014 and the cable to try to learn the electric guitar & bass I bought myself (without knowing how to play them). I also bought a ThrustMaster T80 steering wheel & pedals for use on a couple racing games which is a must have for DriveClub, but sometimes too much of a hassle to bother with if I just want to chill out and drive around aimlessly exploring in The CREW.Look me up on PSN if you want to play. PSN ID: Chameleon_69

  I've grown up with every Playstation, but I went from the PS2 to Xbox 360 when Call of Duty was actually good, and ended up selling it and getting the PS3.  I ordered my PS4 on December 22nd and got it Christmas Eve.  I started playing the Free2Play games BlackLight Retribution and Warframe, already playing them on PC, they're just as good on the PS4.  I got Killzone Shadow Fall, Knack, and Battlefield 4 on Christmas day and I still have so much fun with them!  Plus the free games that came with PSPlus are very fun too!  I just got InFAMOUS Second Son and started playing it while it was downloading and it's awesome so far!  I've had absolutely no drawbacks with the PS4, or any Playstation I've owned for that matter.  My brother owns an Xbox One and it's not that bad, but I couldn't get into it's exclusives.  I had fun with the Xbox 360 and even the original Xbox until Microsoft started taking a huge dive to the ground, starting with shutting down the original Xbox servers, so no more Halo 2 at that point.  I don't like labeling fanboys/girls but from my personal experience, nobody has done it better than Sony.  Simple as that.  Looking forward to Kingdom Hearts 3 and Final Fantasy XV!  My brother being a HUGE Xbox fan is even excited for those games, and he mostly plays the what I think are 'overrated and over hyped' FPS games, and I see him using my PS4 every once in a while as well to play Killzone.  Should have never left Playstation all those years ago, glad I went back!  :)

  i also have not experienced any problems with my PS4. On launch day there were some PSN connectivity issues for a couple of hours but once it started working it KEPT working.As others have stated, amazon's packaging was sub-par. Only bubble air bags on top of the psn in the box, no protection for it underneath. So if the box gets dropped right-side-up, the playstation takes the brunt of the impact.  I find this very unusual for amazon. Usually they take great care in packaging things i order from them. I've ordered shoes that have had more protection than my $400 fragile PS4.That being said, i have yet to experience any hardware issues, though it has also only been 4 days since release.The ps4 interface is fast, intuitive, and responsive. Best feature so far of the PS4 is easily the controller. The touchpad and built-in speaker are nice additions (when utilized) but the best thing is the 3.5mm headphone jack in the controller. You can just plug any set of headphones in them and listen to the game's audio through them. This is great for playing FPS multiplayer and hearing people coming. You do have to hold the PS button down and adjust your audio settings the first time, but its really easy.Graphics look fantastic. Gameplay is smooth and it really makes you look forward to what's still to come in this new generation of gaming.

  After 2 months with the system, there are no problems. I also bought a 1 TB hybrid drive that I put in it from day one. Overall it's a great gaming console. The specifications were the deciding factor for my purchase. The APU with its GCN cores and 8 ACE units deliver 99%  1080p gaming. Also the GDDR 5 ram works better for game graphics. I own a 60"" tv so the resolution of the games is important to me. It's not even close to being as powerful as a gaming PC, but I enjoy playing games on my tv that also has a 5.1 surround sound sytem connected to it. In conclusion: I would recommend the PS4 to anyone looking for a decent piece of hardware.

  I love my ps4. The set up is simple, you can even use the same cables your ps3 had.+The system can easily go from the game to the homescreen without loading time.+The store works a lot faster now.+Games take no time to instal, and you can start playing them, even if they haven't finish installing.-Lack of games can be an issue to some.-Game installation is missing a notification. (you never know when your game is fully installed while playing it)

  After officially of owning the ps4 for a month, I am ready to write my review.Update version: 1.52.The ps4 is sleek in its design and had no trouble upgrading it to a 1.5 terabyte hard drive. After my initial fears of getting a bad product, everything has been working well. The blu-ray player inside it seems to be a bit faster than the ps3 version, and the image looks great.The User interface on the ps4 is easy to use and seems to be a major improvement over the ps3's XMB. Since I don't have that many games, they haven't become a cluster on the UI as of yet. One thing that I do love is the fact all the video apps are on one area in which you can look at everything. I hope that Sony does that for the games as well so they make the UI without much cluster.One weakness of the UI however is the blandness to it for now. I hope updates are made to it so it looks better. The music is nice but can be a bit annoying after a while to some users of the ps4. I however, got no problems with it.The game install times are fast on disc. It installs within 30 seconds to 1:30 seconds, depending on the game. Each game requires an update which you need to start the game for it to download. You can't play online without the updates, however you can play while it downloads. Once it finishes, close the game app and once it finishes installing, go back to it and game away.The playstation store seems to be faster here, comparing it to the ps3, but it doesn't have many things to buy as it still needs to be updated with newer games. It lacks content as it came out a month ago yesterday. The playstation plus system is great for those who have a ps3, ps4 and/or vita system as it gives you free games (rentals) beta invites, and online storage for your saved game files. This month, they gave away contrast and resogun. Good indie games that can keep you entertained while the newer ones come out next year. If you do want to play online games however, psn+ is needed, but you can still use netflix, hulu, vudu and all other media services at no additional charge since they are not behind a paywall.The controllers have changed quite a bit from the ps3, adding to it a sleeker design and better grips for the hands. Not to mention a touch pad and changing where the start and select buttons would be, which are now called Options and Share.The Option button works as a pause button for games giving you direct access to the options menu where you can change the settings of the game, as well as other options given to you within the game. The share button gives you 3 options while you are gaming, giving you a way to take screenshots, upload videos and a streaming option via twitch tv and Ustream. Lag may occur on the streamings depending on your internet connection and bandwidth.The flaw I see with the controller is the battery life, and only one cable is brought within the console and extra controllers do not bring a charger. The good news is any micro usb will work with the controller.So your own cellphone chargers for android phones could work (so long as they are micro USB.).Voice commands can make the system work well for you if you bought the camera. Supposedly the headset mic can be used for that as well but I haven't tested it. Sometimes the voice commands do get wonky but it works well to take screenshots without the need to hit the share button.The wi-fi internet connection on the ps4 seems to have improve from the ps3 settings. I would always have issues with the ps3 on the wi-fi settings, but the ps4 seems to respond better. Though I would recommend keeping it wired for better connections.One final note would be the remote play. It works well in certain areas when the system is close as there is no lag within what you are doing on the console to the tv. Similar to the wii u's second screen, the vita can be used as a second screen for the ps4, or to play the game through it, without the need to hog the tv. It works wonders in a concrete house. However, the touch screen can be a pain to use in certain games.Freezes and bugs are common for a console and I did get one glitch in the system yesterday while quitting the movie Turbo from the system. It just stayed there with the loading circle on the screen. Even trying to turn off the console didn't work. I had to go in manually which I do not recommend under any circumstance. One good thing is, if the console shuts down unexpectedly or not in its usual way, you can report to Sony what happened through the ps4.Overall I have had no truly bad experiences with the ps4 as of yet and through one month of solid gaming I have enjoyed it very well. I give it 5 stars. However for any normal consumer, given the fact that it did froze on me once, and some things don't work too well because of updates needed as well as some tweaks, I give it a 4/5.Should you buy a ps4 right now or wait? I would suggest wait until the psvita/ps4 bundle or until more games are out there. If you have a ps3 or an xbox 360, both consoles are good enough for now and are still given support so no need to truly jump into the next generation unless you wish to do so.Hope this review helps everyone and happy gaming.

  I'd wait a few months before getting a next gen console, but I'm definitely glad I got the PS4 and not the Xbox One. When am I ever going to watch TV while Skyping someone while playing a game?But for real, I have some games... the graphics are amazing and the potential is crazy, but the pickings are slim at the moment. Should be pretty great after Summer 2014 though.

  I purchased this (original PS4) when I got a refund for an electric shaver.  It was around 200 dollars and in very good condition.It plays well and I have no issue with it.  If you’re planning on getting a PS4 and you want to save money, it’s a good deal.  Just make sure you’re dealing with a trusted seller.

  Unlike half the people who claim to have got a faulty unit, i actually got a great one out the box. My PS4 has been working for a week now with no problems what so ever. No problem connecting to PSN, no install problems, i updated my PS4 on day one with no issues.Thanks Sony for making another great consoleI also want to thank Amazon for their great product availability, i pre-ordered my system in July with a delivery est of December - January of next year. A couple months after i placed my order Amazon emailed me saying they will be getting more consoles pushing my normal PS4 to a Launch Edition PS4. After that i had a delivery date of Nov 18th. but Amazon also changed that and moved me to launch day shipping after it wasn't available when they changed itProps to Sony and Amazon for handling this launch so well

  So far so good. Love this thing. Works super fast and is awesome. I love the PS4. Games are expensive as usual, and the servers on BF4 aren't much better even after having to pay the yearly fees. But it is still a great system.UPDATE*****************************Let me clarify. Playstation Plus ($50 per year) is now required for multi-player content. It was free before, which was nice. Now we are told that they will charge so that they can boost their network infrastructure.Shuhei Yoshida said:""The main pillar for the PS4 will be online play. We're developing many new ways to play and connect which requires a large investment of resources. Considering the cost, to try to keep such a service free and consequently lower the quality would be absurd. We decided that if that's the case, then it would be better to receive proper payment and continue to offer a good service.""Yes the BF4 servers are their own issues with EA. BUT their servers are using the PS Network, that is supposed to get improved.I have also had lag and problems with Killzone, which is a Sony game. And my internet connection is definitely not the problem (20down/5up). Talk to anyone, lag is still an issue. You cannot find a single player who doesn't get bothered by lag.That all said, I still LOVE the PS4. It is definitely quicker and a great value. I wish it would have been a higher leap of quality. When the PS3 came out, it was extremely powerful compared to other PC's and devices of its time. The PS4 is barely on par to today's devices at only 1.84 Teraflops. Although the Xbox One's GPU offers only 1.32 Teraflops.It will be fascinating to see how new games look as they begin to fully utilize the PS4 though.

  The PS4 is great. I am not going to go on about the console itself, there are plenty of other people who have done that. It is a good value, and as the games start coming out hot and heavy, look for it to truely shine as a console. PS+ Membership is a MUST. The games Sony gives on a monthly basis make it a no-brainer.

  I bought the item used at a great price but became worried when I saw the amount of mixed/ negative reviews people wrote about their pre-owned console. However, once I got the item and set the system up, I knew that I got a decent console. The PlayStation ran well and it looked fairly new. I still suggest to be extra cautious of buying used products just in case.

  I've only had the PS4 a few weeks, but so far my wife enjoys it.I'm disappointed that local streaming isn't available, but I have other devices for that.I have my unit on an Uninterupable Power Supply, and keep the PS4 on Stand-by pretty much all of the time, and have had no issues with the automatic downloading of Patches, or Pushed Downloads.I have not had issues with noise or overheating, either. I was concerned about that, but so far so good.I really am a bit happy that we are able to Multi-task, it's something that should have been on the PS3, but hey, whatever.I'm not going to talk about what games are available. That's a waste of time.It's pretty heavy, we've been taught to associate that with build quality, if the weight is really indicative as such then I would say it's a solid piece of equipment.The graphics are fairly nice and if you're not interested in buying a Gaming  PC or just want a console , I would recommend this one.In closing I would like to suggest you take the time to research as best as you can, before you buy. It's pretty likely that you know someone that has a Playstation console of any variation, and most people have had the chance to play one. I think that if you are buying a console for gaming then you should be comfortable with the way the controller feels in your hand. Speaking of the controller, the battery life is fairly good for everything that is built into it now.Okay I'll stop rambling now.

  Review a gaming console? That seems a bit weird as it will evolve so much over time. But I can put in my 2 cents.I love it. It is such an improvement of the PS3 as a system. Everything is thought out. It's as if all the gripes and issues we had with the PS3 interface and abilities were saved for the PS4. We use it for most of our home entertainment needs.The games? I have actually had some real, honest fun. I am a single-player gamer. I like local co-op, but single player adventures moreso. I really enjoyed playing Killzone 4. It had so much more diversity than the previous games. I like games such as Half Life where you adventure around large areas and stories instead of wave after wave of enemies in corridors hiding behind cover. Killzone has those same non-shooting segments where you get to enjoy wandering around, enjoying the beautiful graphics and sound (try playing with the 7.1 sony headset, it is REALLY good 3D sound in this game).More recently was Wofenstein. This game blew me away. I love the old-school run and gun style, it is FUN. I had no idea that the story, characters, and presentation would be so amazing. I had no idea where the game was going to take me emotionally and physically (virtually). I loved the world they created and the people in it. Some classic gaming moments. I've played through multiple times now. So fun.I'm looking forward to where the PS4 will go.

  This console is absolutely awesome. It is quiet and doesn't take up that much space. It is a new design as well making it very easy to place on top of dvd players or even placing consoles on top of the ps4. I currently have my 2nd gen ps3 sitting right on top of the ps4. It is a great console. Also does not use those brick power cords that xbox one has been using

  Everything works great. There are only two flaws; controller battery life and the lack of quality games. The game situation will be changing over the next few months (now its March 2014) starting with Infamous second son TOP NOTCH GAME! The hardware itself is excellent. Try not to download too many games to the system, 500 gb disappears faster than you think.

  As a previous Xbox fan,  there is no longer a need for Xbox.  The PS4 now has indie games you can purchase from the digital store as well as full digital downloads of today's top games.  The PS4 also has all the top entertainment apps, Netflix, Hulu, redbox, crackle etc as well as current movie rentals and sales on the Sony Movie app.  The PS4 not only has all the same top games as Xbox such as Destiny, COD ghosts, battlefield4 etc but there are better full free games available to PS4 season pass members.  Playstation has the final fantasy and DC online MMO's on your PS4 console.  And FINALLY the world has provided the perfect controller!  I used to be a proud owner of Xbox 360 because the controllers were revolutionary back then.  Playstation has now taken it to an entirely new level.  The previous playstation controllers were a bit too small and not ergonomically conformed to your hands before. Now they have been upgraded big time.  The controllers include greater precision thumb handling.  Everything 'feels better' and is buttons are in closer range rather than the Xbox controllers.  Now,  with the added features like controller movement capabilities (where you rock the entire controller) as well as the touch pad in the upper center of the controller,  I really feel this IS the next generation controller.Lastly, With the playstation 4, no Red Ring of Death or any other horrible fears that will be the ultimate (early) demise of your game console like the Xbox.  I know the red ring of death was an old Xbox 360 thing,  but simply put,  Xboxes just don't last as long when you compare the hours of game play over their duration.There is a reason why playstation 4's are outselling Xbox.  Playstation made a superior product for $100 bucks cheaper.Happy owner here!

  Our box was supposed to contain a USB cord and it was missing.  We couldn't charge the controller and we had a very disappointed child on Xmas morning that couldn't play with his game for this reason.  Very disappointed after spending so much money on this item.

  Foremost, I was satisfied to have received my delivery days before the estimated time of arrival. On top of that, the Play-Station 4 arrived nicely intact with all its promised equipment as advertised and was wrapped securely for travel. When I turned it on, everything checked out to be operating for the full gaming experience. In short, I am content with the product this seller sold.

  I had to take time away from my gaming to write this review, let me first say that im writing this with my fingers crossed. I know that alot of people are going through the misfortune of having consoles not working and i sincerely hope Sony makes good on this ASAP. As for my experience i opened the unit up and threw out their cheap HDMI cable, I also loaded up all drivers via USB, I highly recommend to do this as the play-station network is sometimes sketchy with all the people hitting it up for downloads. Everything went smooth as silk. Addressing some of peoples concerned with loudness and popping, from my computer experience the only clicking/popping im hearing when turning it on is simply the power supply and definitely not something to worry about. I have no cosmetic/dents/broken pieces issues at all other then the slight wobble when pressing on the rear left of the unit (read cons section for more info on this) and of coarse i had no ""BLOD"" i would like to thank the USB install of 1.50 for this though because PSN is pretty sketchy right now and i would not be surprised if during the download process the connection is lost and corrupts install data in turn causing a BLOD, but just a thought.Now on the other hand as for Amazon's shipping, like others i do believe they went a little lacking on materials, its almost like they found a box that fit the PS4 100% snug and just stuck some air packs on the top to fill in the space. I would have liked to see a box double its size with peanuts/air packs on both sides of the unit. Alas i received my ps4 in one piece and its working so i cant complain.ProsAwesome graphics !Amazingly fast UI (even within PS network)DS4 controller is awesome and feels much better then the previousController has a head phone port (did not even know this !)super quietlooks great !Great Indie games, my favorite games so far were FREE !The speaker on the controller is just an awesome idea !ConsLimited games as of right now (but i bought into it knowing this)No backwards compatibility to PS3 gameswould like to have some background customization themes for the UI, but all in good timeSmall complaint, im not sure how much juice the light on the controller takes, but i would bet it would extend some battery life to have an option to turn it off, but then again it looks awesome ! so im not sure i would want it off lolAnd last but not least that dang wobble ! For the life of me i cant figure out why Sony did this. The wobble is going to be on almost all units. This is not because of poor QC like alot of reviewers are stating, and its definitely not defective. The PS4's LED on top follows around the console and onto its underbelly. The line of plastic/rubber on the bottom is lifted higher and their for creates a rocking motion. Why sony would design it like this is beyond me and it changes nothing, i just wish they would have added 4 rubber feet to all four corners just like they have their previous consoles instead of this one rubber fin. nothing i could not add myself though. :DAll in all, I love it. Fingers crossed that i don't run into issues, but ive talked to alot of people in gamestops/bestbuy and they have never had any problems either, i truly believe this is an isolated issue. I wish you all who have gotten a defective unit a fast recovery and from my perspective having it repaired is worth the wait :D

  The new PS4 is great. No complaints so far. The controllers are a great new design.The games have been slow in coming, but I'm assuming thats because its a new platform.From what I have seen, if you're looking for next gen console then this is you're only choice.The free games online are cool as well.The xbox one is a bad joke with its poor design.

  All in all I'm impressed, but its not without its annoyances and problems, and thats why I'm writting this. I hope Sony fix these issues.I give this four stars as its added all the stuff I wanted added to the PS3 functionality, but unfortunately removed some key things too.First the good stuff...--------------------------* Party Chatting* Removable HDD* Quiet* Charge Controllers while in standby* Remote Play* Graphics are great* Built in PowerSupply (but 120v only)What I read is coming----------------------------* DLNA is coming back* Support for the PS3 WIreless Stereo HeadsetsThe Annoyances...------------------------PSN* Once again network was overloaded on day one. Everyone predicted it. Happens everytime there is high demand. Sony should have made sure it didn't happen though (was back online after 3 hours of trying though)* Sony still don't allow me to use my UK in the USA store. Makes it a problem for me to buy games in the USA where I live and download DLC etc.. Having 2 accounts means I have to pay for PSN Plus twice and also screws up my trophies.WWW BROWSER* Slows down the PS4 alot (weird)* Doesn't support Flash (but does support HTML5... for youtube, goto  [...] and click the button request HTML5player)CROSS COMPATIBILITY* Can't play PS3 games, nor PSN games downloaded for the PS3HARDWARE* No Video Out at first (Got mine at work and tried it on a monitor via HDMI but no video. Tested on another monitor with other cable and worked fine)* Not a fan of how it looks personally* Only 2 USB Ports, should have 4* Doesn't support Bluetooth 4 LE* Doesn't have Wifi AC* Power and Eject buttons are surprisingly difficult to press, although not often usedCONTROLLER* Light on back is a bit bright* No indicator light on top to know which controller is turned on at a glance* Options and Share button are awkward to find/press (but getting used to it)* Dimple in the sticks takes a while to get used toUSER INTERFACE* Main screen is gonna get cluttered if you have lots of games (I hope they attend to this in a later update)* Less Organised than the old XMB* I seem to be missing all the 'down arrow' extended information about each game (I had it on friday, but now its hidden, wonder if its a network issue)USER PROFILE* Not easy to see when you are Logged In or Not (I guess the plan is to always be online, but sometimes I don't want to be disturbed)* Couldn't find a way to set Online Status (to Away or DND)* Not easy to switch User (forced to log out which turns off controller, then you have to turn it back on etc...)AUTO UPDATE* Downloads for other games and updates seemed to happen while I'm in online battle and affects my internet connection. (Think you might beable to turn this off, but I didn't find a way)MESSAGING* My PS3 friends see me as offline and chat messages are semi functional* Cant Send Screenshots to PS3 friends (I want them to see the cool gfx)SHARING* Can't Share screenshots to anything but Twitter and Facebook (I use neither)* Can't set it up to view share options without taking a screenshot (ends up with tons of needless screenshots)* Can't delete screenshots from the share button window (have to goto profile and click on the folder then options)CHAT* Supplied headset is awefully cheap. Plus I can never get those to stay in my ear (I bought the 'PS vita headset' to try out)* Can't use any (I have 4) bluetooth headsets for chat (device incompatible)* Can't use the 2 PS3 Bluetooth headsets I own* Can't use either the old or the next Surround Wireless Headset either (yes I own both)MULTIMEDIA* Can't Stream Videos or Music via DLNA (I relied on this)* Can't play files from external devices either (I relied on this too)POWER* Not sure about this.... After 9 hours straight I started getting serious slowdown/choppiness in game, it wasn't hot though (but I think It could have been auto updating in the background and slowing the internet connection, or the controller was about to die)

  massive graphics improvement so I can imagine when the developers really start unlocking the potential. I do find the control dies faster than in the ps3. Oh.. the lack of 3d is a bit of a downer. had to end up buying a separate 3d player hence the one star less. interface is much improved too

  This system came in fast and worked perfect right out of the box even included an HDMI cable. The controller is amazing and I prefer it over the x box one controller and the x box 360 controller. The controllers handles are longer and more ergonomic than the shorter more edgy ps3 controllers. I started out with Tomb Raider Definitive Edition and Thief (both awesome) and the loading screens were always under 20 seconds and these graphics are mind blowing. The camera for the system is $60 so that's not too bad if you're into that stuff. There are a few mini games the system comes with for the motion control and camera, and you can download free add ons. The overall battery life of the controller isn't the best. I think the ps3 controller had longer battery life than these. The sleek design of the system looks really good on your entertainment center. Viewing netflix and other video services is easier than ever because you can press the ps button while watching a movie and it goes to the menu, then go to netflix again and it is still where you left off. Same with any application, even games. So far a really awesome game system and a nice investment.

  This is a very good console, though it isn't all that different from the other 3 PlayStations. It is big on sharing videos and screenshots and all things social media if you care about that. It is still a blu-ray player so that is nice.The swipe pad on the controller is the most notable addition, though it isn't all that utilized. The games that do use it mostly come up with clever and satisfying ways in doing so.The graphics are better than PS3's obviously, but it's not a huge improvement. Video games seem to have hit a plateau in graphics and now just improve resolutions and the like.There are plenty of great games on the console at this point in time as well, so you won't get bored of it.Overall, it's not a very original console, and does everything one would expect a PlayStation to do, and it provides you with plenty of games for your buck.I would recommend buying the PS4 Pro though at this stage in it's life, due to it's better hardware.

  This is a great gaming machine with a fantastic new controller.  Sony usually puts together solid hardware, over the years I have had no problems with my PS1-PS3's, I expect this machine continue that trend.  There are reports of broken systems, but not sure if there is a clear failure rate at this point.  If that all turns out to be overblown then this device should offer a slight graphics edge over the Xbone at the expense of some media and non game entertainment capabilities.  I give it 4 stars with the only knocks being the strict gaming focus, poor launch titles,  and the shakey PSN network/user interface.I have owned all of the playstation and xbox consoles.  My expectation going into this generation is that I will use the PS4 in my man cave for gaming while the Xbone will be in my living room with the high end home theater system.  I need more media support from a device that is going to be the center of my living room.I was dissapointed to learn of the CD and audio streaming restrictions that Sony has decided to place on this device.  I believe they are back tracking on CD support, but I haven't tried to play an audio CD yet. Streaming audio and itunes quality MP3's sound terrible on good speakers, so yes, I still buy CD's.  Sony was looking to push their own audio service and similar to Microsoft with the DRM overplayed their hand.  Its dissapointing because the PS3 was such an awesome media device.  Apparently it will also not support 3d Blu-ray discs, but a future software upgrade may allow this.  My PS3 was the center of my home theater, this machine is a step backwards for non-gaming related activities.Gaming wise the new controller is a huge step forward.  The previous design never fit my hand right and the sticks always seemed a bit floaty.  After playing a few hours of kill zone I am in love with the new design.  Best PS controller to date and its no contest.The launch titles are weak.  Prior gen games with slightly upgraded textures, Knack, and some download arcade games.  I hear NBA 2k14 looks great, but I hate basketball.  That leaves me with Killzone which looks pretty good in spots, but isn't a whole new world of graphical fidelity.  Its was obviously rushed out the door, blood pools flow up walls for instance, but its not terrible.  Launch titles are usually not that great, and I am sure games are coming that will feel more next gen.  Microsoft has a more appealing launch line up in my opinion, but in the long run that is not a concern.In the end I would say if you are games only and have faith in the PSN network this is the way to go.  If you are looking for a center of the living room device or don't trust PSN go xbox one.  If you don't have to choose then get both and the world is yours.

  I love playing the product. However, the previous owners could have been courteous enough to delete their own information off the product before selling, I now even have another profile set up, I'm guessing it's the one who owned it to begin with. I can't delete this one for some reason, the system won't let me. They also could have been more hygienic with the product. It arrived a bit dirty and sticky. I also received a cold a week after having it. Of course Lysol wipes were used upon opening the box, but my immunity could not help the annoyance of raging idiocy that was latched onto the product.

  I have had every Playstation and Xbox and this system blows every other console out of the water. The graphics are visually stunning and unmistakely the best I've seen so far. Even though the Xbox One is a great machine as well, the Playstation 4 just seems like it is the console that was created for gaming as its primary mission unlike the Xbox which makes you feel like Media is its goal.

  Despite the product arriving coincidentally on the last day of shipping for 3 and a half weeks, the representative did respond quickly and the product did arrive un-tampered with everything I was expecting. Would order from buyer again.System plays just the way it should although the UI can take some time getting used to. Everything that was missing and needed from the PS3 is included in this system.

  So I ordered this ps4 day one.I received it and everything was packaged minimally.Pros:It's first and foremost a video game system.Controller is so much better than the ps3 dualshock.The console has a very small footprint and looks cool (vertical or horizontal).I like the upgrade-able hard drive and bluetooth connections.Runs pretty quietly.I like how I can get playing almost immediately after putting in a disc (instead of waiting for the whole install).I like that it didn't come with needless peripherals (i.e the ps eye).Cons:Biggest flaw, no dlna / media server. I still have my ps3 hooked up to watch local content on my network storage. This is a really big deal that they could update later but at this point in time (12/24/13) have not. Why remove such a huge feature? Oh I know, it's because they want to tout PSN's streaming service.Did I mention it won't play cds? Oh it's because they want you to buy music unlimited.It has bluetooth, but older bluetooth devices don't work....I'm talking about the ps3 official remote control.The menu system isn't as intuitive as the old ps3.While I don't mind paying to play online, it does suck you used to not have to.Overall good, but needs to update with old features the ps3 had.

  This console is clearly an upgrade to the PS3. I'm happy with the purchase and happier that I waited until Infamous was released. The game doesn't have much to play as of today but it is still a great new Blu-Ray player. :-p  There's also the Remote Play feature. My PSVita now has a very real purpose. Looking forward to many years with my new PS4.

  I was fortunate enough to find this in stock on Amazon last week so I knew it wouldn't be in stock for very long and got it at retail price instead of the marked up price by 3rd party resellers. I don't have any games for it yet but did get it hooked up and luckily, this wasn't DOA like a few unfortunate customers. It took a few minutes for the system to download updates and install software with a couple system restarts. HDMI cables were provided which was good so you don't need to buy any cables. After updates, the hard drive actually only showed 408GB available so it's not the full 500GB. I've never owned a Playstation before so this is all new to me. I've always been an xbox owner with xbox and xbox360. I wanted to go with PS4 this time because of all the negative things Microsoft was doing with it's xbox one and later backtracked.Since I don't have any games yet, I was able to test out Darknight Rises on Bluray and it was excellent picture quality and sound. I'll probably order a game soon, maybe killzone. The Dualshock 4 controller feels awesome! I always thought the past controllers that I used when playing playstation at friend's house was too small and didn't feel right. For this latest controller, everything feels comfortable.

  I've been keeping up with news on the next gen and still I find stuff on this beast of a console that I never heard of. There isn't a lot of games and I wasn't going to get it this early but I sold my Wii and wanted to upgrade so I didn't have to buy my games all at once. The Wii hit my wallet pretty hard last gen with the release windows being so close together. But this gen I'm going to get the ones I really want and enjoy it at the same time with other gamers. So far I really love this system.PROS:-Smooth Online-Nice controller with improved 6-axis controls-Fast loading times-All TV media is available [Hulu, Netflix, etc.]-Day One patch isn't big/doesn't take a lot of time-Easy setup [Physical and software]-Easy to navigate through menus-Can record and take a screenshot of gameplay and share it-Can download apps and games while in standbyCons:-Not many games available right now.

  I was one of the very few lucky ones to purchase one of these PS4 units at midnight the day it went on sale here on Amazon. I bought it for my 14 year old son for Christmas who is a dedicated Play Station user and has been since PS2. So I was very excited that I lucked out and got it from Amazon for the retail price of $399 and free two day Prime shipping , the way it was meant to be. However after reading about the blue light of death and other complaints that reviewers were posting I spent the next couple months stressing and praying the unit I purchased would be ok. Well I guess the man upstairs heard me because we hooked this baby up Christmas morning and had no problems at all. Connecting was easy and after turning it on setup was just as easy. Downloaded some updates and connected to PSN without any problem using his old Play Station Network user name and password he had with PS3. The performance and graphics are absolutely amazing! Far better then PS3. Even the new Battlefield 4 game that so many reviewers complained about seemed run almost flawless for my kid. He also has Assassin's Creed and Kill Zone  for PS4 that are even  more amazing! It was a very Merry Christmas!

  I have never been a huge PlayStation person but I couldn't go without being able to play the FF7 remake. The seller provided me with a fully functional PS4 console and all the accessories necessary and it works wonderfully. If you're on a budget and want a great system, order one of these.

  The PS4 is obviously a better more amazing console then then the PS3 as far as gaming power. But the ps3 did a better job with multimedia such as CDs music and external hard drives.I am a gamer so the ps4 works out perfect for me simce i can live without the multimedia capabilities. It has some great features specially in the controller that are missing on my Xbox one. I like the motion sensors and built in speaker. This isn't a deal breaker but nice Wii like touches that make some games more interesting.I highly recommend the ps4...If you are deciding between the ps4 and Xbox one then I would use the exclusive games and what your friends have as the deciding factor. The ps4 can usually handle more frames per second then the Xbox yet some games like AC Unity run better on Xbox. Also unless you run two TVs side by side you can not usually tell the difference between both consoles.Now when larger games like witcher 3 come out ps4 might be the console of choice for that game unless you go PC. If you have the ability to do so I say own both ps4 and xbox one so you can enjoy all the great games to come.

  I ordered my PS4 on January 4th. I was one of the lucky few who managed to get an order through at that point because of low PS4 stock. Initially, it was supposed to be delivered by the 15th but instead, I got an email saying delivery was pushed up to the 8th (always good news). So I got the excellent PS4 earlier than expected.I'm not going to go into the PS4 itself, there is already all the information you need elsewhere. What I will say is that if its available to you, I would not hesitate to order a PS4 through Amazon. Delivery was quick and stress free, and I couldn't ask for more from the console.

  With Vita functionality, a great DLC cross play base, and a solid line up of games to play throughout 2014 this system will give you exactly what gamers want.  A gaming system, with fewer multi media/Comunity features that the XBone offers Sony has sided with core game pay and hard wear features to be its calling card.

  This is one of the best consoles I've ever played, but it is far from the best, at least so far coming up to it's one year anniversary. The PlayStation 4 was supposed to be known as having all the games while the Xbox One has all the media, but I don't think that is the case. The games for the Xbox One have been slightly better in my opinion, and the dashboard and Xbox Gold are much better now. Sony has taken a dangerous approach: they are in the lead, but they are squabbling and not innovating enough. Things like DLNA media playback, MP3 playback, and resuming games from sleep are promised features that are still missing. 3D Blu-ray support just came today AFTER Xbox One, which is sad considering Sony has been very aggressive with 3D and Blu-ray. That being said, I still think this is the better system. I don't know all the components, but it is known that the PS4 is faster and more powerful than the Xbox One, and some may say this is irrelevant, it may become more apparent down the road. Either way, it still gives me peace of mind that I have a more powerful system. I would have said it's cheaper, but now it is on par with the Xbox One. PlayStation Plus is a great service that I am much happier paying for than Xbox Live Gold, but they are becoming more and more equal.I do like the trackpad, the controller itself (way more than the Xbox One controller), the new R2 and L2 triggers, the look of the system, the feel of the operating system, and let's not forget about the great games that ARE coming, such as 1882: The Order, Destiny, The Last of Us PS4, No Man's Sky, LittleBigPlanet 3, and much more. If I had to buy a new console over again, I would pick the PS4 100 out of 100 times.

  This was the only Eighth generation console that I did not have. I got the Wii U and Xbox One at launch and all three are great and offer something different to offer. The PS4 is very fast and quiet. The Setup was very simple and so far (knocking on wood) I have had zero issues with it. The new controller is a great upgrade from the Dualshock 3. My only complaints about it which are minor is not being able to turn off the light on the top of the controller really drains the battery, and the rubber on the joysticks feels fragile. There have also been a lot of reports of the rubber wearing down and cracking on the joysticks. I prefer using FPS Freeks from Kontrol Freek so this should not be an issue. I ordered two sets made for the PS4 the CQC Signature putting one each on the left stick of my controllers and the FPS Ultra putting one each on the right sticks and it is a nice setup. I completed Killzone Shadow Fall and the graphics looked amazing. There are not a lot of games out for it right now, but it did only launch 4 months ago today. I am looking forward to playing inFAMOUS Second Son on the 21st and Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes on the 18th. The Remote Play from the PSVita works very good as well and is a nice addition if you own a PSVita. So yeah so far so good and I am looking forward to the upcoming exclusives and two thumbs up!

  I've owned my PS4 since the beginning of this year, and there have been few games to truly capture my interest. The first-person shooters are few and far between, but there's enough for you to find your niche. Playstation+ offers some indie titles to keep your interest, but a lot of them are 8-bit style games that don't really show off the true power of the device. There are a lot of great games coming out before the end of the year, so if you're on the fence, don't hesitate to purchase a PS4.There are plenty of streaming apps for you to consume media, including the big names like Amazon, Netflix, and Hulu. Sadly there is no YouTube app, but you can use the internet browser for that. There is no baked-in streaming functionality for media on your network, but apparently Sony is working on releasing that at some point in the future.4 stars because I see the potential, but haven't been wowed yet.

  This system so far has been amazing, each feature is unique ranging from the specs of the controller. Simple things like the the headphone jack  that allows you to plug in your own headphones to listen to audio and your friends in chat at the same time all through the controller the light bar producing different colors as you play different games also doubling as a move controller, the touch pad which is a quick solution to slow typing on the consoles and  even the shape and design of the ps4 itself , ive had both the xbox one and ps4 and i can say there both unique in there each way but for now spec wise and design wise ps4 won me over after being a huge xbox 360 fan that says  a lot and i would highly recommend this to anyone looking for an affordable way of getting a great gaming experience instead of blowing thousands of dollars on a pc to achieve max graphics and frame rate potential. This is the console of the future and the true next gen console.

  Ill keep it  short and steer away from the fan boy/ idiot hater rants. It is the best PS ever, simply put. The interface is sonys best so far and on par with the Xbox One (which i also own). The interface is much much better and actually more attractive though less intuitive than Xbox's (though the xbox one is not as good as xbox 360's...see my review). Anyway it is a very attractive unit and looks at home amongst the high end av stuff in my entertainment center. The game quality is fast and beautiful though i only have one cross platform title as of now (assasins creed 4) so the speed difference the PS4 has on paper over the Xbox One is not noticable ( i rented AC4 on xbox one... no visible difference as expected in a cross platform title). The main reason i give it 4 stars is the HORRID controller. In its defense i have never liked sony's dual shock controller, i always though it was too small which leads to finger and hand fatigue. And now that i have osteoarthritis in my hands from limes disease and a lifetime at the keyboard it makes a big difference. I will as always have to wait for Power A to make a Fusion controller to play it. Otherwise a great offering by sony but with so few good launch titles, i find myself not turning it on as much as my xbox one.

  I will admit that I prefer the Xbox One over the PS4 because of the overall experience (controller, xbox live, etc). I have been waiting for a good reason to buy the PS4, and the deal of Amazon ( PS4 + The Last Of Us + Bloodborne + 20 Store Credit ) was exactly was I was waiting for.In terms of graphical display, I am not sure if I can see a real difference between the PS4 games and XB1. There is for sure since the specs favor the PS4. But I cannot notice it, so I leave it to those with super eyes to decide. The one thing I notice with the PS4 games (Bloodborne, the last of Us, Shadow Fall) is that while the graphics are beautiful the world seems empty.With the graphics out if the way, I have to say that this machine is a piece of art. I love the simplistic approach of sony on this powerful little guy. Nice looking, small footprint and good quality.The only difference is that the ps4 does not support External usb HardDrive to store games and play them from there like the XB1. While I can upgrade my internal storage to a bigger drive I am not convinced that i want to do that. So this may limit my game library.This deal on Amazon cannot be beat. I am having a great time playing the last of us, and my game library just increased to 3 more games. If you can afford and have the time I recommend to leave the fanboy stuff aside and buy both, your fun will only double.

  I'm giving 5 start because the system is great but there's nothing good to play with right now the ps4 has power but there's nothing that is going to wow you at this time. Is like the ps3 when it first came out it sucked but now it's a power house and running on one core. so the ps4 with 8 cores I can only imagine What sony will have for us in the future.

  Decided during E3 that I was going to go with the PS4 due to price and Sony's attention to the gamer vs. publishers with the then controversial Xbox One decision to halt used game sales.  Microsoft went back on that but the good will that Sony earned, plus the $100 price difference really drew me in.I got my console on release day and after a few hiccups with setting up the internet (which could have been user error) I was ready to roll.  The UI is basic, but that's not a negative.  Everything you need is on one bar that scrolls horizontally.  Your most recent games played come first and the game in the console itself is the first in line.  Your video services are grouped in a video folder of sorts to avoid clutter and the overall experience of finding a game and playing it is seamless.  I can see this possibly being an issue later in the console's life when there are a lot of games to sort through but I doubt this will be the design choice the PS4 has in 5 years.  Software updates come and go and I'm sure it'll change.The real draw of any new console though is what it can do.  This particular device plays PS4 games and those games look amazing.  There aren't a lot of games out right now to actually play but the ones out of note include Killzone Shadow Fall, Assassin's Creed 4, Need for Speed Rivals, and Resogun.  If you picked up only those games you'd be set for a true next gen experience with amazing visuals and all around great games.The PS4 is a great investment if you're looking to get into next gen gaming on the console.  The Xbox One is an alternative choice for people who want a more media focuses experience, but for those of us who want to spend less for just an all around great gaming console, you can't go wrong with the PS4!

  I've had mine for over a month now and it's been a great machine. All the games I get at no additional charge for being a PS+ subscriber, Tomb Raider:DE, and now Infamous have been great. The much faster UI is greatly appreciated over the aging and slow PS3 UI. I really love the Dual Shock 4 as well. I've always preferred Sony's controller design to their competitors and this is the best iteration yet. Between the PS4 and my PC, I think I'm good to go for the foreseeable future.Also, news that The Last of Us is getting reworked for the PS4 nearly caused me to faint. So excited!

  A console for gaming by gamers. True there is much more you can do with it, and even more coming down the road. However, right now I have no complaints about the cost, capabilities, design, support, or durability of the playstation 4. Bought mine at launch, and she had ran smoothly ever since. The controller feels sturdy yet comfortable, the physical size and design of the unit allows for ease of installation and integration into my living room setup. While not necessary, ask the social media bells and whistles are cool. The current and upcoming games are beautiful and lots of fun.AC4InfamousWatch DogsKnackLast of Us remasteredUncharted 4I upgraded my HDD to a 1 tb with ease (then sold the 500gb on Ebay)If you are on the fence hop down and get a PS4 today!Check out my YouTube for the  unboxing video and other gaming vids.gamertalkchannelJesus bless you and good gaming!Http://www.YouTube.com/gamertalkchannel

  I have my issues with the 30FPS and costs from a technology and consumer stand point. The 500GD HDD may become a problem in the future as well but that is remediable for a cost. Other than those points it is a nice console with nice features for those too lazy to switch to cable or watching videos on a computer. I would not suggest buying this console if you only have a perspective interest in few Sony games, but for those looking forward to Playstation games it's a solid console and entertainment system.

  Let me preface this by saying that I have owned all previous PlayStation consoles, and the Xbox 360 briefly.I love this console! The UI is beautiful but still simple. So far everything is very responsive, background downloads and other features are great, and I have had no issues with the console.It also looks pretty good sitting on my desk.

  My only issue with this was I thought it was coming with a controller and charger, but I only got the HDMI cable and power cable. I had to call to get a controller and it'll be here in a few days hopefully, but I did get a chance to play a game and set it up and everything works fine, it was beautiful graphics, fast, and that suspend or rest mode is a brilliant idea, pick up from where you left off at, no matter what you were doing.

  The PS4 has really exceeded my expectations and those were very high.  I've owned all the consoles at launch since I was a child and got a NES which wasn't at launch but I was really young.  This console is a lot better compared to the 360 and PS3 launch and I'm enjoying the new social features and UIThe controller is incredible and a massive improvement over the dualshock 3 which I hated in almost every way.  The controller is a lot more comfortable to hold, has real triggers for R2 and L2, and the new thumb sticks are excellent.  The battery life seems shorter than other wireless controllers but it's nothing that will hold back from the experience. I'd say its equal to the 360 controller which is my favorite controller in console gaming history.The console itself is small and aesthetically pleasing which is surprising because launch consoles are usually enormous and hideous.  It is quiet and I updated the hard drive to a 1 TB hybrid drive with ease.  I installed the day 1 update from a memory stick with no problems and haven't looked back.I own four launch games Knack, Killzone, BF4, and AC 4.  I have played lots of knack which is surprising as after reading reviews I almost cancelled my pre-order.  Killzone is incredible as well and I'm loving the multiplayer portion.  I have played BF4 and was impressed but it needs further patching.  I have yet to play AC 4 because I hated AC 3 but decided to get Black Flag as my free game in the buy 2 get 1 free promotion.The UI is clean and extremely fast and responsive.  I've used party chat and the provided headset isn't bad for simple chatting purposes.Overall this console is great and it has a bright future.  It may not have the games that make you buy it instantly but there are a lot of games on the horizon.  You won't be disappointed!

  I really like the look and feel of the PS4. the only issues i have with it is that sometimes when i turn it on theres no sound and i have to reboot it to get sound so minus 1 star. Looking on the web i can see that im not the only having this issue, but for the cost, the hardware functionally should at least work well. The final issue i have with it, is that i got PSN plus and theres just not any content much like the current game selection. These last two issues i mention will be fixed in the future but i wish that i did not have to reboot the PS4 to get it working right.

  I passed over a launch day console due to my bad luck in the past on machines that didn't work on day one.  My intention was to wait until Second Son was released so I would miss out on the buggy first few months that can happen with a new machine...but just couldn't wait that long.  I made it about a month before I gave in and picked up a PS4 on Amazon.  I waited awhile before reviewing since the initial game line up was a little weak.  Now I've tried plenty of new games over the past few months, with some of my favorites still to come.  I really choose the PS4 over the XBOXONE due to what I felt was a slightly better first year of game line up.  That and the price point were the major sellers.  I've always been a playstation fan but really enjoyed the XBOX360 the best out of the previous gen consoles.  I will still pick up a XBOXONE at some point, maybe a year or so.  But for now I really love the PS4!  Great choice!  Some of the major pluses for me are the controller, which I find to be the perfect size and shape.  And the UI.  The navigation is smooth and I love the Playstation Plus membership.  Really worth the price of admission.  I even find myself renting movies and tv shows from the store.  Even the Apps are smooth, but only a limited amount available currently.  All in all super happy and can't wait for some the games coming in June and beyond.

  Was nervous when I picked this up from the local UPS location, all I kept thinking about was getting a D.O.A system. I got home carefully connected to my t.v., which was very fast and simple. I got everything set up on the network, etc.. everything seems to be working fine so far. The UI is pretty plain and easy to use, as well as navigating the settings. I'm only giving 4 stars due to the lack of games out at the moment, but the machine itself has a ton of potential. I ordered mine @ 12:01 a.m. Friday morning and had it in my hands today, mine came from the Chattanooga,TN location and was fine. Just an FYI for those trying to pin point where the defective systems are coming from.

  I picked this up and immediately upgraded COD - Ghosts to play on it to see the difference between it and the PS3.  The graphics seem sharper and the load times seem better.I do not like the fact you must now purchase Playstation Plus to play online games, but at least you get a free game a month with that service.  The online store is easy to navigate, but the game selection is still fairly limited.I found a free to play game Warframe in the store and have found that to be very enjoyable.  Overall I am happy with my purchase.

  My brother and I both purchased a PS4 back in June and finally recieved it about a week ago. So far I have enjoyed everything about it. I a few hours worth of games and have had a great experience so far.  The pros:-Small Size, I expected it to be much bigger and take up more room, but boy was I wrong. The size is perfect.-Excellent graphics. I have been playing on a high def 50+ inch screen and have seen nothing but perfection. It was more than I expected. I figured I would have some fps issues and the like but nothing so far.-Excellent controller...the battery life has been lasting for quite awhile before needing recharged, I managed to grab a second controller for a friend to play along with me and both have been working very well. The controller also feels very durable and high quality. Not to mention I love the light bar that is build in. I personally can't wait for it to be implemented in more games (the eye that is)-Dashboard software os or whatever it's called now is very nice and easy to navigate through. I personally did not like the layout of the ps3's, they managed to change it enough to where I truly like it.  The cons...-The PS4 charging cable for the controller was kind of short. I had the controller built in battery ran out of juice during some gameplay and since I was on a massive screen I didn't want to keep playing while it was plugged in, wayyyy too close to the screen for comfort had I otherwise.-Dust Magnet, maybe I don't clean my apartment enough I don't know, but man it collected some heavy dust all over it. If you are in a similar situation keep a can of air nearby to keep it looking perfect :D-only 2 usb ports, I am unaware if we can get away with attaching a USB hub, but I felt 3-4 would have been preferred.Overall a very solid system and I am 100% satisfied with my purchase. I hope they release more soon so that everyone has an opportunity to get their hands on it.

  I love it. It's quick and elegant. The design is very modern, and the interface was easy to use.The only problem that I was that it took a long time to update. There was no problem with the actual console, The problem was that the Playstation Network was offline probably due to high traffic. I tried again after a few hours, and my PS4 updated within 1 minute.I installed a disc game (Assassin's Creed 4) within 1 minute or 2. Very fast.Other than the PSN being offline (which is not a problem for PS4 but of Sony), the PS4 is great.

  Next generation of game consoles, but being new lacks the great games available on the PS3, PS 4 has more social features built in for sharing on the internet. Sony has adapted the Apple model of iTunes and Amazon.com, selling you a gaming system with the latest and greatest tech at a reasonable price, but making it up in add ons, higher price games, game upgrades from PS3 on some games to PS4 usability. The games so far available show off the PS4 super graphics (eye candy) but lack great story telling like Uncharted series from Naughty Dog. The PS4 as well as the Xbox 1 is not backward compatible with earlier games from PS 2 or 3, so hold onto yours if you have a lot of games that you like to play on them.  A lot more of the new games will be available as DLs that install directly to your HD on your PS4, but I notice that the pricing of some games is higher than if purchased as used games from Gamefly or Gamestop on disc. As with the earlier Playstations as time goes by we will see more and better games that will show the full potential of great games as Developers learn of the possibilities of what is possible.

  Got it all set up and updated within 30 mins. Downloaded 3 digital games one sitting at 43 GB ( I think ) was playing it within 2 hours of initial update. No problems with anything so far, runs nice and quiet.Edit: After almost a year of using it I still thing it works great! I don't play it has much as my Xbox because really I bought this for one game. But have bought many great games for this system. I have noticed playing bloodborne that it tends to get a bit hot. The fan is continuously blowing trying to cool it off. I haven't noticed this with other games, but like I said I don't play it often. I just started to get back into Bloodborne and noticed that the fan is working extra hard to cool it. This would be after 2-3 hours of game play. This might be normal, but I have all sides open, nothing blocking the intake or outtake vents.One thing that does annoy me a lot is the R2 and L2 triggers. I can set my controller down and the slightest bump will make them activate. When taking a break I have to now prop it on my TV remote so the triggers are not touching anything, because if i set it down on the couch or end table it will swing my sword or shoot my gun in bloodborne. It is pretty annoying at times!

  All i have to say is pay attention to the Amazon verified purchases of the PS4, not the reviews by the trolls. Sony has reported a 1% failure rate, which is to be expected with any new electronic. I've had my PS4 for one week now and i must say, i'm impressed. The redesign of the Dualshock controller was much needed and appreciated. The Dualshock 4 controller has finally gotten it all correct. Your fingers finally line up with the L2 and R2 buttons, unlike previous controllers, which they seemed to line up with L1 and R1 instead. New to Sony's controller is and added speaker. The speaker comes into play in both games i've played so far, Resogun (Playstation Plus Awesome Shooter Freebie) and Killzone: Shadow Fall. In Killzone, recordings and such that you find in game are heard through the speaker, making it much easier to hear what is on the tapes. In Resogun, the stage announcer is heard through the speaker. I'm sure as the generation goes along, the speaker will come into play quite a bit in PS4 games. Sony also added a light to the back of the controller, which atleast in Killzone, changes color as you get close to death and such. A different color also will be displayed for each controller, when playing multiplayer games locally with friends. This is a nice added feature as well, for those times you take a break, and all sit your controllers down together. The different colors make it possible to know which is yours, even from across the room. The PS4 console itself is much smaller than i expected it to be, and that's a good thing. Good things come in small packages they say, and this is true for the PS4 as well. I personally like the redesign of the XMB. It in itself is nothing groundbreaking, but it is much more simplified, and makes it way quicker to switch between the different catagories. The PS4 graphics, atleast for Killzone, have a noticeable difference as well. The textures are much smoother, due to the full 1080 P, which only the PS4 does, so far this generation. I really can't wait to see what game developers will do with the power capabilities of the PS4. I especially can't wait to see what Naughty Dog will do with Uncharted 4. I don't want to leave out Resogun, which is available on the PS4 online store ($14.99 For The Normal Price, Or Free For Playstation Plus Subscribers), as it in itself is a pretty awesome shooter. It will surely keep you occupied for many hours, if you indeed are a shooter fan. The graphics are a next gen custom, update of the classic style. Resogun was made by the same people that brought us Super Stardust HD on the PS3. In closing, read the true reviews on here, not the Xbox fanboy ones, which are just there to confuse you. In the end, read the reviews, specs, and capabilities, and make your own decision. There's a GOOD  reason that Gamestop is now reporting over 2.3 Million people are on a waiting list for the PS4, buy one and find out that reason

  Finally, the PS4.  As a console, the design can take some getting used to since the eject button blends in with the console itself.  I wish Sony would have brought all of the music, photo, and video streaming from the PS3 to this console.  It seems strange that I can't have a photo of my wife as my background photo now.  I really love the headphone jack on the controller.  When I'm gaming late at night, I just plug in my Sennheisers and choose to output audio to them.  As soon as I unplug the headphones, the audio automatically switches back to my surround sound.  I wish it came with two controllers, but the PS4 does have an option to leave the USB port hot for 3 hours or all the time.  I chose the 3 hour option to charge my controller after shutting down the system.  HDMI output can be a little flaky.  I figured out I have to turn on the PS4 first to the point where it's outputting video before I turn on my TV.  I didn't have to perform a special sequence with the PS3.  Also, the wifi on the PS4 isn't as good as the wifi on my PS3.  It's probably a firmware bug because it can see my network, but it won't connect since I have MAC address filtering on.  I ran a long ethernet cable from the PS4 to my router.  It just reached with a few feet to spare.  Besides these issues, the console is awesome.  Just waiting for the next Uncharted and Gran Turismo now...

  So I thought I ordered a PS4 original console. Meaning the first version of it. When I opened up the box it was the slim model. Not at all what description read. And clearly NOT what I wanted. But I don’t have the time to be returning items and waiting for a refund so it is what it is.

  Very happy with this system so far. It boots up quickly, the menus are very snappy and the UI is easy to navigate. So far I've played Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, NBA 2K14 and Resogun. They all run super smoothly with no framerate issues. The machine itself is very quiet and putting my hand over it while gaming the heat doesn't seem to be too crazy. It vents itself well.The DualShock 4 controller feels natural in the hand. A huge improvement over the DualShock 3. It has a bit of heft to it making it feel more substantial and that it is of a good build quality.As for the features, the sharing button and it's operation work very smoothly. It's seamless to share screenshots and video via twitter and Facebook. The only downside is that these are your only options at launch and Facebook's video compression leaves a lot to be desired.All in all the system is a strong foundation for the future. The launch lineup is not stellar (what launch lineup is?), but the hardware is solid and built for the long haul. Can't wait to see what the future holds and glad I get to be a part of it.

  Received my PS4 on launch day from amazon and love it, Have not even cracked open the new games I bought with it yet since I have been addicted to contrast which came free with my PS plus. one nice feature is when i turn the system on via the controller my TV automatically changes to the input and my receiver switch to my ps4 profile, this happen if you turn on the HDMI link under system setting and your equipment supports this. also note it works both ways if i change my receiver to ps4 it will turn on the system and switch the TV over. The controller feels better then the DS3 just wish the charge lasted longer. sorry to hear about the BLOD some people are seeing, I did buy 2 systems (1 i gave to my sister's family) and hers was ok. anyway back to playing.

  PS4 has it all! 60 fps games,true blu-ray,1080p gaming,live broadcasting with gameplay of games or with the playstation eye and play room, broadcast yourself! The PS4 main feature I really liked was being able to minimize the game and go into something else such as netflix but one main thing I do not like is not showing part of the subject of a message you get when you receive from someone like the ps3 was where you could see part of the message to know if you wanted to minimize the game or not. and the minimizing option is good in some ways but it is dumb in another because if you wanted to check messages you'd have to if online find somewhere safe to check your messages or you'd die due to not seeing your game in the background like the ps3 had. This does not support 3d as of yet but it will in the future.All of my complaints can be fixed through an update if they'd bother to do so. But overall as a gaming system other than your pc, this is a must over the xbox one.

  I was so much looking forward to this but alas, it malfunctioned as soon as I set it up. The moment I put a brand new disc in, it started making noises.  Wouldn't eject the disc, and the system would not register that there was a disc there at all. Now the only way I can get it out is by taking it apart-  as soon as I got it! The system will not update, either.

  Always impressive, Sony has once again given us gamers a great update to the console it introduced so many years ago.With a great new interface, the PS4 offers users a fresh, new experience while still feeling familiar enough to eliminate too much of a learning curve.  The PS4 gives us great graphics, generous memory, upgrade-ability, lots of wonderful games at launch, and plenty more on the way.One thing that surprised me about the PS4 was the weight of both the console itself and the controllers.  Compare by holding a PS3 controller in one hand the the Dualshock 4 in the other and you'll find there's a big difference.  The PS4 is considerably heavier.  I suppose it just means there's that much more good stuff packed into this one!  It's nothing that would in any way change my decision to purchase the PS4, but was just surprising.For any of the more casual PlayStation users out there, please remember this version is NOT backwards compatible so you CANNOT play your PS1, PS2, or PS3 games on this console.

  Arrived on time and work perfectly out of the box. The graphical upgrade is nowhere near as night and day as the ps3 from ps2, but it's still noticably sharper and more detailed than the previous gen. The social aspects of this console are wonderful: easy to use and fun to capture video and share with friends, cross game chat finally, real friends names, Facebook connectivity, all are welcome additions. The game library is a little lacking (as far as the first party games or concerned) but with a solid lineup of third-party games as well as a history of eight years of solid PS3 exclusives I have no worries that the games will come; plus we've already had an announcement for uncharted 4, which is worth the price of admission on its own.

  Will update as i continue to play. Originally bought for my son for Christmas. Do to all the bad reviews i had to open it to make sure it worked. Will continue to play it off and on when my son is not at home to make sure it is fully functional.Everything loaded up just fine, did the updates and downloaded all 4-5 free games and played them.  You get access to PS network for 1 month free, music 1 month free, $10 to go towards purchase of a game on the network,No weird noises, overheating, constant blue lights, etc..  Only thing i am alittle confused about is... I want to add my sons name as another user on my account. I want him to have access to the same network and games i downloaded. I get a message stating only one user per account. I am confused on how to have multiple users play on one machine.PS:  Shipping box was horrible!  The amazon box was literally half way open exposing what was in it!  Never had a shipment that cost so much arrive like that lol  But glad everything works!  Anyone no how to add my son to my account as stated above please respond.

  I managed to get my PS4 by coming to Amazon at midnight on November 14th. 3 minutes after midnight I was able to go ahead and order my PS4.  It arrived on Monday the 18th with two day Prime shipping and I was disappointed with the packaging.  There wasn't enough packing materials in the box to keep the contents from rattling around. If this box had been shaken the contents would have been damaged. This is my only complaint about this order.I've had no problems with the PS4 itself.  the console set up easily and has been running now used heavily without problem. If anything changes I'll update this review. So far so good. I'm loving it. One needs to understand that with a million units sold in the first 24 hours, network traffic will be heavy. This is not the fault of the console. I found that in the late night hours Eastern Standard Time the network tends to be less busy and things download quicker.In playing Call of Duty Ghosts both on the PS3 and the PS4, I can see all the differences between the next gen and its predecessor.  The DualShock 4 controller is amazing.  It's tighter in the analog sticks with indentations and rubber coating.  It makes gameplay much easier and less stressful on the thumbs.  There was no frame freeze or lag, unlike my experience with the PS3 version.Warframe is a definite plus. I've been waiting for it to come to console and the PS4 is a worthy candidate to handle it.  After playing last night for a few hours, there was absolutely no frame freeze or lag either.Though there are a few features missing now that I'd like to see, I'm sure future updates will remedy my desire.  I'll definitely be adding the camera to this one as I can see Sony is doing major development in that arena.

  Caught this ""Like New"" from Amazon warehouse.  Works perfect. Games look beautiful.  I own the XB1, Xbox 360 and PS3.  They all have their positives and negatives. However, I have my XB1 and PS4 hooked up to the same tv and I will say the PS4 looks better.

  Everything it does, it does very well. A few things that I would warn others of before a purchase follow.It has 4 USB slots but will not recognize/play any audio or video on a thumb drive. I had hoped to move the ps3 from the living room to the bedroom, but since we use it for home videos, photos and playing music, it has to stay there. I know it's a game console, but it came with about 10 or so apps (premium services) for streaming video and music.One other thing is the way it handles downloads/updates. It's great that everything happens in the background, but you no longer have the ability to pause and resume downloads. You can only cancel them. That means, if you want to watch a movie and download a demo, they both suffer or one gets stopped. No thumb drive mp4 support and not being able to pause downloads is a losing combination. Downloading several at once takes forever as we'll.It's very good at what it does, but it's certainly no replacement for a ps3.

  Hello, I'm not new to using Sony products. I've been with the PlayStation brand since the PS1. The PS4 is still new to me, but from what I've read it packs a lot of power for its size, (it's close to the PS3's dimensions) I'm enjoying it since I've started playing it.

  A great piece of gaming hardware.  By far the best of the new consoles.  Best bang for your buck and it is actually designed to play video games.  the new Dualshock controller is awesome.The new User Interface is sleak and clean.  Easy to navigate around.  I can see it getting a bit crowded the mroe you download, but expect Sony to issue an update to create more tabs in the near future.  Hopefully they allow some coustomization of the UI.The PS4 is tiny.  It's smaller than my PS3 slim.  It reminds me of the PS2 slim from back in the day.The slanted design is not as goofy as I had thought it would be.  I actaully like the look of the machine.  The lightbar on the top is not as obvious as I was afraid.  i was thinking it would be like the Wii's blue light on the disck drive, but you hardly ever notice the lights on the PS4.All in all it's a great gaming system.  I can't wait for some of the big AAA games to hit the market in the next few months.

  It has been a great experience, started off with some PSN issues but just so many getting it from start, now it flies through the PSN, games load quick, everything is just fast on this beauty and I have no issues with the console.  Excited for the future, specially infamous coming soon.  I got injustice, killzone and marvel lego.  They all are amazing games and look great, all coming in at 1080.  I would suggest if unsure of which console to get this holiday season, to maybe wait it out and see what future games you like before making a choice.  I like the line up of games for the PS4, starting with infamous, Destiny, the order and new Uncharted announced.  Plus tons of PSN games available, I am totally supporting the Indy games on the PS4 also, and there is tons of those I am looking forward to, specially octodad.  But right now resogun and contrast are tons of fun for the start.  Also the PS plus plan may seem costly, but trust me with a member of that program for a bit, it pays for itself in the future, giving you free games that are worth the plan, also discounts towards new games and so it for sure is a benefit.

  I was an Xbox 360 owner without any real fervent advocacy for one system or the other. Honestly, I find it hard to care about the debate about which system is better blah blah blah graphics and who cares about what games are ""better"". The really good titles will be available on both, and they both offer similar services.But Microsoft messed up. Big time. I almost bought the PS4 out of spite for the Xbone. An immature impulse, I know. But I had the choice of one or the other and technology only moves one way, so I couldn't resist.Immaturity aside, if that's even possible, I am pleased with the PS4. It's graphics are amazing and the new controller is responsive and balanced. As far as streaming, it's faster than my Google chromecast and the apple TV my SO has. And you DON'T NEED the PS plus network to gain access to the internet. That last bit along should be enough to convince you. I do sign up for the PSN now, only because AWESOMENAUTS, but I don't mind the free games I get every month either.I guess I've become a Sony fanboy since owning this device, insofar as my attention span will allow. Still, I think anyone who looks at the numbers and the cost-benefit of each system will make the same choice. It's the better selling system for good reasons. 10/10 will recommend again.

  Thus far I've greatly enjoyed every aspect of the ps4 I've tried. I will note I don't play online all that much, so this review won't remark on that. I chose the ps4 after much deliberation between it and the xbox one, not because of the exclusives it has right now (I'll admit it doesn't have many) but for what I've seen it will be getting in the future (bloodborne, uncharted 4 and so on). While i ordered the system before the announcement, I was relieved to hear that street fighter 5 was coming to the ps4 (exclusively) so I lucked out there since I'm a fan of the franchise.Hardware wise I've read many times that the ps4 has (a very slight) edge over the ps4 and has more games running at 1080p or more consistent 60fps. This info, coupled with my preference of adventure / action / rpgs and upcoming exclusives, pushed me to the ps4. And I am thus far very satisfied. The games I own right now are Injustice: Ultimate Edition, Infamous: Second Son, Dragon Age: Inquisition and Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare. Only really played Infamous and Injustice thus far, but have had a lot of fun with them and I'm really looking forward to getting to the others.The ps4 is smaller than the ps3 for what that's worth to people and the controller overall feels like a big step forward for the playstation controller design overall.

  Console arrived a lot earlier in the day than i am used to, but thats the only plus I will give the shipping team. Like others have said, my ps4 was placed inside a box with air bags on top of it. Most damage is going to happen on the bottom of the box, conveyors, loading and unloading will tear the cases up very quickly. My unit was not damaged and I have been enjoying it.  I do wish there was a better lineup of launch titles for the ps4. I bought Shadow fall, COD and BF4. I am disappointed  with shadow fall because I loved killzone mercenary. COD is cod, nothing new. BF4 I've played very little because i need a friend to back me up and none of my friends bought a ps4,  They are too busy with GTA5 to make the jump.  Console is very quiet and doesn't seem to get very hot. Seen some videos on some shoddy thermal paste and it makes me wonder how mine is inside. i build pcs for gaming and thermal paste is very important to the longevity of the cpu. Also seeing that massive fan and the way it dissipates heat from the apu is a good thing. My pc can trounce my ps4, but it is about 10 times the size and only 2 friends play pc games.  Overall I am very happy with my purchase and believe I will enjoy my ps4 for many years to come.

  Size:The PS4 is actually slimmer than the PS3 Slim which is phenomenal as I tend to carry my console everywhere I go so it is convenient for me since its not clunky or heavy at all.Gameplay:The games play like a dream and it appears that the PS4 install majority of the game from the disc so there would be very little sound of the system loading from the actual disc.Apps:As of right now, there is a lack of apps so I can't play youtube although it can be done from the internet app from the PS4 . Pretty sure future updates would address lack of current apps available for the PS4.Best Feature - Remote Play:FINALLY able to utilize remote play from the PS Vita to the PS4. Every game that doesn't require the PS4 camera has worked so far on remote play and absolutely loving it.Overall - great system with some room for improvement.P.S. Unlike other retail stores, Amazon was actually reliable in honoring their orders once accepting my payment for the PS4 as I had horrid experiences in trying to acquire the PS4 from other main brand stores as they would give me excuses like something was wrong with my payment information or apologized for running out without updating their information.

  The reason for this review is the poor packaging job Amazon did with my PS4. I have been a Amazon Prime member for over 5 years  and spend thousands of dollars on Amazon each year and the way the PS4 was shipped was by far the worst.The box it cam in was way too large and protective air pillows were only use on the side of the box. The PS4 was able to bounce up and down inside the box. One of the corners of the box was pushed in because there was no support on the inside.I got luck and my PS4 is fully functional with no issues whatsoever. Compared to my PS3 the PS4 is a big upgrade in all departments. The System runs much cooler and quieter, the UI is greatly improved and the dual shock 4 is also better than DS3.the only negative I can think of is the lack of blockbuster titles at launch.

  Fits perfectly on the pull-out keyboard tray of my desk next to my keyboard. My ps3 wouldn't even fit there. Plus there is no power brick. That's unreal. I wouldn't have anyplace for that huge xbox1 and it's power brick. Looking at these consoles it seems very obvious who worked on theirs longer and harder. It breaths new life into my seldom used vita. I can play my ps4 via the vita through wi fi. Anywhere. You will want to get one if you don't have one. And the second screen playstation app is a great useful feature too. Amazing. The controller is much improved on an already great design. The touch pad is also a big button. Can't wait to see it we'll implemented.  I love the concave analog sticks, no slippage. The live streaming is something I did not think would hold my interest, but it does. I watch the streaming, as well. Whatever question you could think to ask about whatever game, you can pretty much get answers for immediately. Regardless of weather you are a social media fan or not, there is a lot that it offers. The console is super quick and has none of the lagging xmb dashboard hold ups. Comparing trophies, everything. Gameplay is unmatched. I requested two day shipping, It arrived promptly. Amazon shipped it upside down in the box. Not really what you want to see with expensive electronics. I can understand better all the complaints of broken ps4's from amazon. Mines ok though and I don't really care about yours so I'm very happy.

  Very happy with my new console.  I find the new Dualshock 4 controller to be comfortable and responsive, which for me is a huge improvement over the previous generation's Sixaxis and Dualshock 3 controllers.  My system runs quietly and hasn't shown any heating issues after about 12 hours of play throughout the weekend.I tried out the video sharing service with a short clip of Battlefield 4 uploaded to Facebook.  It would be nice to have sound with the video, but as it is the file sizes are small and the upload was super fast.  Editing was as simple as selecting the start and end points from a series of screenshots, and the entire process from hitting the share button, trimming the video, adding a comment, and uploading to Facebook took less than 90 seconds.All in all, I'm very pleased with my purchase and expect to get a lot of enjoyment out of it for years.

  The PS4 is small, sleek and it kinda just works. The games look great, the OS is straightforward and, for the most part, pretty intuitive and the controller feels great in your hands.Where the XBO feels like a reimagining of the console, the PS4 is more like an improvement on the PS3 foundation and I kinda dig that. Everything is familiar to the point where I know where to look, yet still feels new and shiny. And the improvement over the PS3 are vast. Everything is snappy, you can get in and out of games in a snap and you no longer have to quit a game if you want to go to the PSN store or web browser or settings.I've ran into a few minor annoyances though. First one is the buttons. They look like normal buttons but are capacitive (I think). However since they're flush with the system I'm never sure if I'm pressing them or not because there's no feedback. The PS3 buttons always made some kind of sound when you pressed them and it's weird they didn't do the same for the PS4.Also it's great that they expanded the friends list to 2K, but it's almost impossible to manage a list with more than a hundred or two friends. It's an endlessly scrolling list and it refreshes too slowly.The controller battery is also pretty disappointing. And while the idea of plugging in some headphones directly into the controller so you don't disturb those around you when you play late at night is great, the max volume is pretty low. It feels like it's capped halfway.Overall, if you like games, you can't go wrong with a PS4. Currently I'd wholeheartedly recommend it over the competition right now, but only time will tell who the real winner is.

  I, like many Amazon purchasers, was worried to turn on my PS4. I didn't think it would turn on, I was sure I had a brick. But low and behold, it turned on. But then, I was scarred to update my firmware to 1.50, the update which adds many key features to the system but after updating the system was working fine.I fired up NBA 2k14 and played a quick-game while it was installing. I then downloaded Resogun which downloaded in less than 5 minutes.This is a great system. The console itself is so sleek. This is a ""sexy"" machine. I also love the controller, super comfortable.

  Ordered it Dec. 28, 2013 via Amazon, received it Dec. 30, 2014. Also purchased the SquareTrade 2-Year Game Console Protection Plan ($350-400), better to trust a 3rd party company(the ""lawyer"") than the actual company itself.Runs(loads/start up) games fast. The new, for Playstation, Party Chat is very very nice. Playing Battlefield 4 at 1080p(they say its actually 900p, but my TV only reads either 720p or 1080p, etc., not in-between) and 60fps is like butter, and the 66 player server capability is great!!My Turtle Beach PX21 Headset works with it, allowing me to wait for a wireless headset to come on-sale.My ONLY BIGGEST PROBLEMS ARE:--The controller's battery lifespan is like a 1985 battery, literally.--Why must Sony ALWAYS provide a cord for the controller that is TOO SHORT as if we're playing up close like PC gamers? Forcing the majority of us to buy a 3rd party extension cord(there different, the PS3 USB is a ""mini"" whereas the PS4 is a ""micro"" WTF!?!)--Sony has yet to release the HDCP reversal update for us YouTube uploaders. Personally, for me, the share button for Facebook is a waste, though I understand many people may like that.

  this is by far the best video game console ever created. i bought the xbox one day one and havent really enjoyed the console much. it was only the variety of games xbox one had to offer that i saw as an advantage over the ps4. however, i was surprised at how much difference the controller made. the ps4 controller is also the best controller out there. it is almost like a ps3/xbox 360 hybrid controller. it looks like the ps3 controller yet it feels as good as the 360 controller did with the upgraded l2/r2 buttons and the thumbsticks. the grip feels so nice you dont have to squeeze the controller to hold it comfortably. the ps4 is also significantly smaller and more compact than the xbox one. the xbox one has an external power source with the utilization of the very space consuming power brick while the ps4 is lighter and it has an internal power source. the xbox one has better games, but the ps4 just looks better and has a better controller and in my opinion better value with the addition of a cheaper online subscription service which also includes better offers than xbox live deals

  Totally worth the wait and price tag.  Their video game library is slowly building and look forward to see what games come next.  The only feature they could've added to make it 5 stars is adding an HDMI thru/input to make it possible to run an external HDMI cord so I don't have to keep disconnecting my PS 4 from my stereo system in order to connect and use my other HDMI capable device.  In this case, my laptop.  Overall SONY put out another fine piece of electronic equipment.

  Happy with ps4 it is easy to setup, I just want to say though when I first turned it on I noticed the disc drive was making loud noises, So after I had set it up I shut it down and turned it vertically and then turned it back on the noise stopped and I popped in a blu ray movie and everything was fine. I think maybe cold weather here or just from sitting around in the warehouse caused the drive inside to stick.Just want to add an update about game installations in case people are not aware, when you first pop in a game the disc drive gets a little noisy that is only because its performing afull installation of the game which takes about five to ten minutes. At the same time you will be able to play the game while it installs and when the installation is done the drive becomesvery quiet.

  The Playstation 4 is a major upgrade to the previous Playstation 3. As an Xbox and Playstation user, it's easy to not hold a bias as I've seen the pros and cons to each console.Comparing it to the previous playstation three, the only thing I find that I miss is the ability to upload movies from a USB flash drive, but it's understandable with the new movie features, as Playstation wants you to use those instead.The controller is larger than the PS3 controllers, but it's not overly big, such as the 360 controller, in fact, I find it to be right in the middle and fit comfortably, much more than the PS3 did. The grip is better and I don't find my hands get as sweaty with them.The party chat, which IMO was really the only single thing that held the Xbox 360 above the Playstation 3, works like a charm and identical to that of the 360 (the layout is obviously different).The Playstation 4 has had a 0.4% fail rate, but that's expected with any new electronic device. That however is extremely good for the sum one million plus that have been sold.

All of my blu-rays get played through it; Verizon's Redbox Instant, and Amazon Instant Video services are great; and I use the NHL App to stream live hockey games almost daily.  The last movie I rented streamed at 1080p and 5.1 digital audio without a hiccup.  The gaming graphics give my 2500 dollar custom PC I built a run for its money thanks to the massive amount of dedicated video RAM; my PC actually has less.  Every game will likely be 1080p.  I can't wait to try the remastered The Last of Us!!  It runs at about 1/3 the temperature of PS3.  The only real gripe I have is the required PS+ subscription to play online (only 49.99 per year, though, which is less than 5 a month).

  So, there have been MANY conflicting reports about the PS4.  I came to share my story.  And as you can see, I'm a verified purchaser.First, let me address the elephant in the room.  Products sometimes fail out of the box.  This is true with ANY electronic device.  In fact, Sony seems to have been very good about making it right with those who have had issues.  Is the failure rate as low as Sony says?  Probably.  There's no way to know right now.  Rest assured, I wasn't going to review this at all because I was having such a good experience.  So keep that in mind.  If your Playstation 4 is working as intended, you are playing it.  You probably aren't going to write a review.  That being said, I wanted to take the time to review it so that it might ease some of your fears.  With that disclaimer out of the way, let me review this thing.First things is first, the device itself is beautiful.  It's sleek and much smaller than I thought.  A good bit smaller than my PS3 slim, actually.  It will fit right in to any entertainment center and be a conversation piece for years to come. It's that nice.Aesthetics aside, setup was a breeze.  Basically, if you have a PSN account, you log in, an update downloads, and that's it. You're ready to play.  The first thing you'll notice is that the user interface is a good bit different than before.  Things are a lot more streamlined now.  It is very easy to navigate, and also easy on the eyes.  Nice upgrade here.Games are why people buy this machine, though.  I have Battlefield 4, Assassin's Creed 4, NBA 2k14 and Call of Duty:Ghosts.  When you insert a disc, it begins to install immediately.  You can't start playing instantly the first time you insert the game, but have no fear, it only takes a moment.  Each games seems to handle these installs differently, but each is really elegant.  For example, the first time you insert NBA 2k14, it takes about 30 seconds, and the game loads.  Now, when you first start, you can only play a quick game, and there is no commentary.  That's because the game is installing WHILE you play.  That's so awesome.  After one quick game, everything was done and installed. Sweet.As for little things I've noticed about the user interface. Application switching is awesome.  So you are watching netflix, but want to play a quick round of Battlefield?  Double tap the PS button, and you are instantly in your last application.  No downtime or loading. It's instant. You are done playing a match, and now you want to go back to Netflix? Double-tap again and you are instantly back where you paused.  Amazing.Just to wrap up, I know this was a brief review, but I wanted to get it out there.  MY experience has been great. System runs cool, quiet and quick.  I have been having a ton of fun and really haven't even scratched the surface.  The only issue right now is a lack of games, but that's the way it is with any console launch.  As the year goes on, this machine is going to get stronger and stronger.  Are there issues with hardware? I'm sure. It's bound to happen.  But honestly, even if the number of bricked units is 1% worldwide, that would make this one of the most reliable electronic devices ever released.  If you are in that 1%, sure, it sucks. But don't let that deter you.  If you are a gamer, pick this up with confidence.I will update this review as the months go on, but again, after heavy-use for 3 days, this machine is a beast. Enjoy!

  Fantastic next-gen console.  I wasn't expecting a significant increase in graphics performance but I can say I was pleasantly surprised when comparing Ghosts on the PS3 to the PS4.  Much sharper, crisper graphics and colors are beautiful.  Big difference. The unit itself is beautiful - I like the sharp edges and matte black and glossy black exterior.  The light bar in the center is a nice touch, too, as long as it isn't blinking blue!  For what it's worth - I know it SUCKS for the fraction of customers that experienced the bad systems...  Just try to be patient.  Sony (or Amazon) will make it right.  I was one of the unlucky folks that had the cooling issues with the PS3 and Sony definitely took care of me.Controller is a major upgrade too.  Feels bigger and the buttons are spaced out a bit more it feels like.  Good for people with Yeti-hands like me!  Triggers are a major upgrade and I like the touchpad in the center.  Looking forward to more uses in the future.Downloaded Contrast last night, too, and would strongly recommend.  Great game and very challenging.So far so good with the console!  PS4 for the WIN!

  Fortunately my PS4 never has given me any major probs. Ive had it since launch. The games that are out for it now arent worth the upgrade but titles will get better later this year. Console has faster loading times, all games are in 1080p and you can stream vids. It still has a few kinks to work out. At times the console will just freeze up and i have to put it in sleep mode or at times unplug it. And at times the PS store doesnt load. The controller is comfy and you can charge it while you play. I just wish this console had more usb ports. It at least needs 4. Accessories easily take up these spaces. Also it needs a bigger hard drive. 500gb its probably enough to download every retail game from launch up until two months afterwards which isnt many. You dont actually get 500 of course. Thats a round off estimate. At least you can change out the hard drive though. I love the share button. So fun using it as a snap shot button for when people get crazy through streams. Congrats Japan on your PS4 release!

  We got our PS4 delivered on launch day. After about two months of use, we have a clear idea on how this console actually plays vs. the pre-launch media hype. We have never owned a Playstation or Xbox of any generation, but we do have a gaming PC.Pros:- Great graphics in 1080p, good performance. The indie titles like Flower and Contrast actually show off its graphics better than Madden, probably because the big games were all designed with the older generation in mind.- Good selection of non-game apps. Not as wide a selection as the Roku, but certainly better than Apple or Chromecast. You can finally watch Netflix or Amazon Prime on your console in full 1080p glory!- Wide variety of power-saving and auto-shutoff options- Add your fellow PS4 users to your friends list, share clips or achievements, find each other ingame- Easy drop-in multiplayer gaming on the same console.- Gaming quality is comparable to my PC (not the highest-end PC ever, but pretty good all the same)Cons- Lack of games. But, this is always true at every new console launch. 2014 will see the game catalog start to catch back up to PS3 levels.- BUGS. One of the most annoying one is the wifi failing to work sometimes for no apparent reason. Only turning the system off and on can fix it. Also, turning on and getting nothing but a black screen sucks, especially since there is no hard power switch on the unit. You have to literally unplug the PS4 and replug it in. And there hasn't been an update from Sony in weeks. Can't separate their engineers from their bongs, I guess.- Can't play PS3 games! You'll have to hang on to your old PS3 for the foreseeable future :(- Hard to obtain. I saw this console being offered for close to $1000 just before Christmas.- Expensive controllers at 60 bucks a pop. Want a full set of 4? You'll have to cough up $180 plus tax.- Lack of same-console multiplayer options in favor of single-player FPS games. This is more of the fault of gaming companies, but still. When can we get our GoldenEye back?

  There are so many things that I could say about this console, but I will just choose a few. Some people have gotten bad consoles, it happens, it's called DOA or Dead on Arrival. Which means electric currents went through them during shipping etc after manufacturing at some point. I got a good console on January 15th, which is the best time to get one since most ""manufacture"" issues are fixed.GAMES: Lets just say games are always going to minimal at any launch. We look at the PS4 and we see a small selection, did you buy PS+ or PlayStation Plus? Well look no further you get a free game per month when you are subscribed which is now required for online play, here is the thing Xbox One doesn't do the free Games, Like PS3 as more games become available, we get more per month. So far I have gotten: Don't Starve: Console Edition, Outlast (Really cool Horror game) and Dead Nation a zombie game similar to Diablo 3 on consoles. Overall the games are great for what I have paid for!Console: The console and the OS (Operating System) are really smooth, user friendly, and very slick. It's amazingly fast also. I can say it does lag at some times, but when you have a console with a new OS of course there will be issues which can be fixed in updates etc. Overall I have no issues with the system.

  I was a little hesitant going into this, expecting a more or less PS3 with more powerful hardware.  After spending about 10 hours on it over the weekend, I must say that I am very impressed.  The system is quick, powerful, and easy to use.  A lot of the little features here and there are well polished and awesome (face recognition log in system is very cool).Thus far I've played most of the free games available to PS+ members and the free to play titles on the system (Warframe, Blacklight, etc).  They look good and operate well.  The streaming feed service via Twitch & Ustream works great.  The friends system works much better vs PS3.  Once DLNA is patched into the system, I'll be set.  The camera is pretty cool too and seems like a worth while accessory to pick up if you want to utilize everything the ps3 can offer.I've got Killzone on order so that should show up soon, looking forward to that.

  I ordered the console off Amazon within 2 minutes of it coming back in stock the Friday before Christmas.  It got to my house on Christmas Eve.  Booted it up, and I knew something was off.  It started in [Safe Mode].  Then went in to download the update, it didn't automatically install.  I had to go back to [Safe Mode] and manually install it.  With this out of the way I got my PSN account set up, linked with my FB account, then started to install NBA 2k14.  I walk into the kitchen and come back and the console was reset.  I logged in and boom it shut itself.  This turned into a constant cycle of going on and off again.  I was really upset.  Called Sony and they said they would ship me a new one once they received mine.  Called Amazon and they sent me one and my new console got here yesterday.  They shipped it before I had even sent mine back to them which was fantastic.Anyways, new console everything went normal, no [Safe Mode], just amazingly fast and smooth PS4, the Next-Gen is here.  Installed NBA 2k14 but turns out the disc was defective so Amazon is sending me a new one.  Since then I have been playing Assassin's Creed IV and it is a lot of fun.  I have also been playing the Killzone multiplayer demo and will probably buy that as it has been fun as well.Overall the PS4 is fantastic, very fast, very smooth, very responsive.  The controller is awesome.  Here is the part I was most impressed with.  I have a set of Corsair Vengeance 1500 V2 USB headset that I use with my PC.  Well I plugged these into the PS4 USB ports, went into the audio settings on the PS4 menu while ingame, and switched it so all audio went through my headset.  BOOM it worked I was astonished they were compatible because this headset had been dissappointing me by not working that great with my PC but now I realize it is my USB ports on my PC that are the problem.  With the PS4 they work awesome.If all you care about is gaming, do yourself a favor and get a PS4.  If you wanna run your media set up through your console and talk to your tv then get an Xbox one.  Both are great systems for there purposes.  Sony has really made a great comeback whereas Microsoft has gone in a different ""total entertainment"" direction.Can't wait for more games and even better graphics to come.

  I've owned systems since NES and now to PS4 and almost everything inbetween, including all of Microsoft's offering UNTIL XBONE. Just to keep things clear, i have been a HUGE sony fan since PS1. But i've owned em all. Coming from a TRUE GAMING background originating from the PC, i can honestly say that im glad to see the PS4 in its current state. its truly a GAMERS console. sorry, but i dont need to talk to my console, nor do i need to wave around my hands like a retard to get it to do things. i have a computer and a tablet for surfing the web, and a perfectly capable box for my satellite to surf my channels. When i power on my GAMING CONSOLE, im doing it to GAME. My PS4 was a launch edition that had ZERO issues, and continues to exhibit zero. I love being able to turn it on, and play a game i want to play on it. Its the truest essence of gaming. I know in time more options will be added to make it more like an entertainment center that the PS3 ORIGINALLY was.(and something XBONE fans seem to forget), and now the XBONE has become. If you're into all of that added luggage, then do not hesitate to buy the xbox one over this console, its by no means a bad console. But if you're like me and tired of gaming consoles trying to be more then what they are intended to be, with gimmicks that offer nothing more then a few novelty features you wont use past a few months, then get a PS4. One look at the oncoming GAMING future of each console will prove my point.

  So let me just start this review off by saying that I think that the PS4 will earn a 5th star eventually, but doesn't deserve it yet.A quick history: I am 31 and have been ""gamer"" all my life, but spent the last gen exclusively with an Xbox 360. After much internal struggle I decided to switch to Playstation for this generation because, generally speaking, Sony has more story-driven games and franchises than Microsoft, who tends to focus on multiplayer shooters. That being said, here are my thoughts on the PS4:1. While the graphical jump from last gen to this gen isn't as great as in the past, you can still see the benefits of the PS4. The Last of Us Remastered couldn't be smoother. The graphics hum along at 60 fps without the slightest sign of struggling to keep up. Really impressive. Can't wait to play Destiny with this thing.2. It is really weird upgrading to a new system that can do less than my Xbox 360 in terms of media apps. The same is true for the Xbox One right now, but it is a really strange part of this upgrade cycle. More apps are on the way, but be prepared to feel like your new console can't really do very much yet.3. The PS4 is surprisingly loud whenever the cooling fan kicks on. I mean, like old-school-Xbox-360 loud. Really disappointing from a brand new piece of technology.4. Playstation Now is still too expensive, but it is perfect for someone like me that missed the entire PS3 catalog. Hopefully we will see PS1 and PS2 titles on there soon. Really a great feature.And that's really all there is to say at this point. I am very pleased with the system, but it still feels like more of a long-term investment than something to get really excited about right now. Without tons of media apps, this thing is really only as good as the games you own for now. There is plenty to look forward to in the future (especially Playstation TV). You won't be disappointed with the purchase right now, but you probably won't be blown away either.

  The PS4 that I received has the flashing blue light problem, a power/harddrive/software problem. Other than that it works fine just highway suggest spending the extra money for something you know will work correctly or is certified refurbished.

  I originally had pre-ordered the Watch Dogs bundle, but we all know what happened to that. I'm glad Amazon decided to update my order into a Launch Edition package. They even gave me some credit towards the purchase of a different PS4 game. That's swell! Thanks Amazon! Got my system on launch day as promised. Too bad it was UPS instead of FedEx because UPS always delivers a little late in my area; I didn't receive my system until 7pm. First world problems. *shrug*There are many reviews out there regarding the hardware so I don't really need to add my 2 cents into the pool, but I will say that the system has thus far exceeding my expectations of what a console should be. Except for the relative lack of media support compared to the previous generation, I'm pretty happy with how responsive the system is and how well it handles my games. I mean, c'mon, I didn't even consider that playing games while the software installed was possible! Sony made a product that's truly great and hopefully the owners will get to experience games that fully take advantage of the hardware capabilities of this magnificent machine.

  First of all, I'd like to state that I've owned a PS (the one is implied, considering I had it when it was only a ""PlayStation""), a PS2, and a PS3. I have nothing against the Xbox. I just never wanted one. I haven't experienced the Xbox One yet--but I know they make good systems, and they (Sony and Microsoft) BOTH have had their fair share of hiccups.I stopped buying games for PS3 months ago. I hadn't heard anything pertaining to backwards compatibility, so I just assumed (correctly), that neither system would be. That's a downer for me. I'm sure they could've figured out a way to make the PS4 play PS3 games. I have a launch day PS3 (yup, it's still kicking), but I guess the later versions removed that feature. Anyway, the system looks I like the slanted portion of the body (although that's likely it is because it's something different in a world of boxes). It's sort of like if a PS2 and PS3 had a baby. You have the finishes of both systems, so you can actually touch it without getting prints all over the thing (unlike the PS3 I have).The overall interface seems cumbersome. I mean, I guess it is okay, but it isn't really something I'm into. There's simply too much going on, for my liking. That's just my opinion. It's user friendly, in terms of being able to go on FB and ""share"" stuff (which I haven't done). PSN didn't work for me when I tried it. I don't know if it was the load, or an update of PSN...but I'm only able to use it occasionally.There is a difference in graphics, albeit slight. I know a lot of games were 720p, but all the ones I have (Madden, AC IV, NFS, CoD, NBA 2k, and Injustice) are all in 1080p. The difference is noticeable; at least to me, it is. This is relative to your screen size. Mine is big enough to notice the difference between the two. The PS3 also struggled to process some of the later games. Although I didn't buy any, I've played some of the heavier games. You could, literally, hear the PS3 struggling to process them. The PS4, though, does it seamlessly. The Last of Us comes to mind, in terms of the PS3 struggling, but it isn't available on PS4.The game selection at launch was a big thing for people. I knew I was going to get it...and, frankly, so long as I get a couple of games I can play, it's okay--so long as I can't play through them and get tired of them before there's something else. This system seems capable.The Dual Shock 4 takes a bit to get used to. I swear, I still look for the start button when I need to pause it. It's the same shape, same concept, but it just takes a bit of getting used to. It should be relatively seamless, with time. The system is quiet, and fits well with my current set-up--so I lucked up there. I'm not implying it won't clash with someone else's set-up (in case that matters).I saw a lot of shipping woes. It was sort of unbelievable the shape some of the packages arrived. Mine came in a box, with the standard air bags, plus the regular PS4 box. Not a nick, not a scratch. Everything was in good order. I don't know if it was because I needed a (slightly) larger box because other items shipped as well, but my shipping was fine. It showed up, in perfect order and on time.Depending on what you're looking for, the PS4 might be it. I think I may have to play it for more hours, just so I know I won't get the same blue light issue...although some of those reviews are questionable. Regardless, I want to play it more so I can have a more informed review. I will update after that. At best, my review will stay the same (I don't rate anything five stars...something would have to be the best, most innovative thing, ever, to get rated five). Worst case, I will down grade it to below four.Here's hoping I don't have to downgrade. I hope this helps!

  Love the console and the redesigned controller. Only complaint is the number of games that interested me at launch, but there are tons of games coming out this year, so only a temporary issue.I had a first gen PS3 which suffered from overheating issues. This was later worked out in the 40GB models but that didn't help me at all since I was going for backwards compatibility. I was a little worried about heat, but it was unnecessary. This machine has excellent cooling, and the rear fans have plenty of power to move that heat out of the system. Be wary of putting it too close to something though, because that will get hot. I noticed this when adjusting things on my UPS, so I had to scoot it a little further away from the outlet to give more room.One of my favorite things about this is the way you can multitask and switch from screen to screen or application to application almost seamlessly. I can be watching Netflix one minute, and within seconds check something in the Playstation store. Once that's done switch back over to Netflix with hardly any wait time.Live streaming isn't a feature I've used profusely, but it was a cool way to enjoy games with friends. We'd hop on a Skype call while I turned on the stream, and we'd all laugh as I'd fail a CoD mission, or get killed attempting to assassinate a target in AC4.Playstation plus for this machine is a must. Even if you aren't a huge multiplayer fan, the games alone make the annual fee worth it. Tons of new games and DLC each month. I was able to get at least 10 games free in the first 6 months that I've had this console. These aren't games that I'd typically buy for myself, but it was a cool way to get to know my PS4. Resogun is an excellent game which kept me entertained and showed me how great the PS4 graphics are.

  You cant go wrong with getting a PS4 right now. Console launches typically dont have that great of games to show full potential of the system, but ill patiently wait a few months till something good comes out.I was worried about the integrity of my PS4 when I examined the packaging done by Amazon. The tape on the box was basically blowing in the wind and not really serving its purpose for keping my box closed....I coukd stick my entire arm into the box without even removing any tape....I can only assume the tape had not been sticky enough when applied so it just didnt stick.bubble air stuff was loosely placed in the box and the console was wrapped in 2 small thin layers of bubble wrap.I use to package stuff in a warehouse for shipping, amazon clearly needs to QC there packaging methods.

  The system has delivered on its promises, the increase in performance over the ps3 is definitely noticeable. Loving the dual shock 4 as well, the headphone jack on the controller is genius & the built in speaker adds a nice dynamic. The system runs very quietly & doesn't seem to get hot as quickly as my ps3 did. The home screen is fluid, & the ability to multitask gives a sense of freedom which was lacking in the ps3 version. The ability to organize the icons homescreen to your liking is all that's missing. Overall it's a solid system, however, I do get the feeling my purchase was premature. PS+ free games for the PS4 have been a lower quality than those released for PS3, i guess that can be expected for a new console. Also I do miss DLNA support more than I thought I would, hopefully Sony adds this feature in the near future. The selection of games is also not so great, it is improving as there are new releases coming out, but right now i don't get a sense of available variety. Also i don't like the parental control system, setting up parental control requires you to register with credit card information. As a customer who resides outside  of the U.S. not having a U.S. credit card & address basically excludes me from setting up parental control for a child account. This limits me to turning on parental control for all accounts or disabling it for all accounts. Also the names of the games are displayed when parental control is enabled.

  The playstation itself was great. The delivery and hassle I went through with Amazon was NOT. When I received this the Sony box itself was busted and looked like it had been thrown down a flight of stairs. Customer service was a real hassle. BUT with that said I kept this playstation since Amazon could not promise me one before February (it was a Christmas gift) and it is still working great. I wouldn't advice throwing yours down a flight of stairs, but ours survived something similar to that while in its box.

  Oh PS4 how I wish you weren't such a pain in the butt.First off lets get the good out of the way.Nice system, good frame rates, good graphics.Ok now the bad things:1. Loud as heck2. Form factor is terrible IMO. The Angles make it annoying to fit in certain places.3. Remote play is crap if you aren't 5 feet from your router or the ps44. Confusing ""adding a controller"" system. What do you mean pick a profile for the controller? My buddy just wants to freaking play fifa with me! (I get it now  but still its dumb.5. Power options don't make a ton of sense.6. Confusing menu system.7. Bluetooth headset don't work (really Sony?)8. Old racing wheels don't work (really Sony?)Anyways lots of little complaints. Its a good system that you should buy for a used price. Probably from Amazon as they seem to have the best prices.

  As a Sony fanboy I have to say I love this system. I never considered getting the ""other"" box. I would have given this 5 stars but as of now there are not alot of games. Happens when you buy a system near launch. This system is small sleek and powerful. If you need any futher proof lokk at the screens from Infamous:Second Son.

  After reading the negative reviews and knowing that I had my system preordered since June, I was worried that I would end up with a brick. I then became more confident that my luck wouldn't be good when my father received a brick (yes my 66 year old father is a gamer as well) 2 days prior.My system came Weds afternoon. I set everything up and got the blue light for a good 12 seconds. Then i took a deep breath of relieve when the ""white light"" came on.I have played it last few nights on avg of 3 hours an evening (i have been flipping between Contrast (free with PSN +) , Madden and Assassins Creed 4. So I have been putting it through its motions. Its shown no signs of wanting to overheat and ran cool.Looks like I am out of the water for the time being.Now for the technicalities...PS store is something to be desired. I understand its a new system to it will take some time to get some things up but as it stands now, not overly impressed. But it will come in time.The UI is ok..Not horrid like some have made it out to be. But its not great either. It is what it is. I do however like the direction its heading in. I see alot of potential as long as Sony keeps working on it.The controller..I love how it feels in the hand. not nearly as bulky as the PS3 controller, not to say it was (compared to the xbox) but in comparison the new controller feels lighter.  Its taking some getting used to without a true start/select button and everything seems to run through the options button. The Share button I haven't played around with too much as i have no desire to show my gaming skills (or lack of) to anybody!Overall i like the system, But hard to give it 5 stars until I see more for the system and what its capable of (and limits). I think 4 is accurate as it stands nowI say if you are on the fence on this or Microsofts system, i feel you will get more bang for your buck.  Just remember too, that other system had a few duds as well. So although it sucks to have a non working system, don't let it deter you from going with Sony because once everything is up and running, i think most will have a more enjoyable experience (not to mention have an extra $100 in your pocket that you would of saved!)

  I have receive my PS4 and absolutely love it! The controller is the best controller that is out right now. Even better than Xbox 360. I bought the PS4 camera and The Playroom is pretty fun for when you have guests and get to show what your PS4 can do. The games are not that great but it's what I was expecting. I am in no rush to get all the new games because I still have a lot of PS3 games that I have not finished playing yet. I already had Playstation so I knew the expectations. I wanted to use the playstation app but because I'm in Japan I cannot download from the Google Play Store. The graphics on Call of Duty and Kill Zone is great!!! I haven't had a chance to play a lot of Kill Zone yet but will play as soon as I am done with PS3 games.PROS:Fast processorEasy to update Hard DriveController is greatCons:Not many gamesNo DLNA

  I love the PS4. The games are good, the video is great, the controller is comfortable and the speaker in it that plays audio logs and similar is funny. The interface is intuitive. If you play often you can put it into sleep mode instead of turning it off. I won't rag on the Xbox One I will just say I love the PS4.

  I've always been a fan of the Xbox over the Playstation. But I've got to give it to Sony on this one. Though I still prefer the xbox controller, you will get used to the PS4 controlled fairly quickly. A simple, streamlined interface makes most things simple. Xbox may make a come back later in the war when they have more games that are worth playing. PS4 is cheaper(because it doesn't come with the  PS camera) and more powerful specs. If you don't have the money to get both the One and the PS4, choose the PS4.

  First off. I'm not a hater of ps4. The console is 5 star for quality. But I'm giving it 3 stars to give Sony a message. 500gb is not enough anymore. We're not living in the 90's where games are 1gb each. Games are massively huge now, 50 to even 60 gig not to mention the DLC you might want! That said, I will tell you I Filled up my console's hard drive within a month after I bought it at launch. Probably 4 weeks I had my 500 gb full. Mind you, out of the box, you're not even getting 500 gb like they say, it's actually closer to 400gb with the preinstalled stuff. Do the math, if you buy 5 games at 50gb each, you've done at least 250GB already. Want 10 games? Forget about it. Yes, we can free up space by deleting games we own, but ya know, how obtrusive and inconvenient is that? I don't want to delete anything off my hard drive. For me, honestly, 2 TB should be the absolute BARE minimum. Yes, we can upgrade our drives. But it's a pain. And the last two times I upgraded, I lost some game saves due to corrupted files. Sony, if you're going to release an amazing console like you did with the ps4, please do what's right ,give us a big enough hard drive so we don't have to worry.Make no mistakes. Awesome games, awesome console. Just no space to put them. Fail.

  BF4 and AC4 look incredible! Can't say enough about the graphics capabilities of this system, awesome! What makes this 4 stars for me are the issues with the bluetooth remote control and the blu-ray player. I wanted to use my Sony bluetooth BD/Playstation remote control I had with my PS3 but it does not work with the PS4. It pairs with the PS4 but none of the buttons work. Also I popped in Man Of Steel 3D and discovered the PS4 does not yet support 3D (supposedly coming in a later software patch). I didn't know about those 2 issues until today when I googled them. Probably buried in Sony's FAQ (I'm sure someone will point me to it in the comments).Hopefully Sony will have these issues resolved very soon (along with the DLNA support).

Do you want to risk your hard earned cash on something you might not use because the games for it suck. I got Killzone with it and not going to get something i can buy for my gaming PC. I got this PS4 system for its exclusives PERIOD.  As a gamer and playstation fan i can tell you my ps3 is getting more play time than my ps4. The system itself is faster sleeker and the graphics well on Killzone alone they do look better than the PS3 Killzones.  Im happy to say my PS4 does work after its day one rollout. The biggest thumbs up for me is the controller on the PS4 hands down just plain awesome to hold. Wait on buying the system guys untill you get that exclusive game you want.

  The PS4 is by far the best gaming console I've owned, it's fast and quiet the only way you'll hear it is to mute the TV, but even then it's not too loud. The size of the console is perfect in my opinion it's not too big or too small, so it should fit in most places just be sure to place it in a well ventilated area. Content for the PS4 is limited, but in time there should be a better selection of games, for now I'm content with AC4, BF4, COD ghosts and KillZone, that should keep me busy a few months. The PS4 remote play on PS Vita is the best feature Sony has to offer, however I did experience some lag on the PS Vita, I'm sure a few updates will fix the problem, if you don't a vita yet, I suggest getting one soon, my only complaint for the PS4 is no camera included with the PS4 launch edition.

  This one is a bit complicated.  Early on, I had a brief run in with ""blue light of death,"" but it went into safe mode, reformatted the HD and (cross my fingers) no problems since.  Now, to the son sole itself.  Firstly, controller is amazing, and this from someone who always preferred the xbox controller for my big hands.  Esp. nice is the speaker within the controller, which gives out different audio information than that coming from the screen and makes for a very unique experience. Sorry that neither COD nor BF 4 took advantage of it.  So far, the only one that has is ""Killzone.""  Ditto for the touchpad, which is also interesting.  Other attributes?  Graphic very sharp, processor clearly shows it's power, and overall happy with my decision.  Already have a roku to handle all my TV and quite happy with how it works.  Xbox turned me off trying to make some sort of ""all in one""....thing when I'd much rather just use my Roku on a diff input.  ANYWAY, so far, the biggest thing missing are the titles!  The processor has all this power and the controller looks so promising, but no game really grabs you and just holds you to the point of obsessiveness.  My advice?  Wait a few months for the ""blue light of death"" to get repaired and some great titles to come out and get a roku 3 for your media stuff. Praying I don't get a permeant ""Blue Death"" anytime soon.

  The controller is such an improvement from the PS3's controller. Not that the PS3's controller was that bad, the PS4 controller just fits in your hand better. The user interface of the PS4's dashboard is very simple and quick. You can be in game and in a second, be scrolling through your trophies. This is the console to get. Its only a matter of time before more great sony exclusive games come onto the playing field, so now is a great time to buy a PS4.

  I am a happy gamer so far. I love the design of this console, and it looks great standing next to my PS3. Background download and INSTALL is a beautiful thing lol. I may never download anything on PS3 again. I remember leaving the PS3 on overnight to get DC Universe Online a few years ago. On PS4 it downloaded and installed within a few hours, while I was playing other games. And I was able to hop right in where I left off on the PS3 version, even though I hadn't played it in over a year. No staring at the screen, waiting for updates. Flower looked amazing on PS3 when it came out, but Wow... absolutely stunning on PS4. The comparison videos do not do it justice. I've got a fairly large TV (73"") and tend to look for details and flaws in graphics. Killzone looks good, Assassin's Creed 4 looks ok, but usually launch titles aren't the best graphically, so no worries. I'm not big on most of the PS4's social features, but I actually enjoy watched others players stream their games, as that has helped me decide on a few games I was on the fence about. I didn't think to charge the controller the first night (after about 4 hours of play), so Saturday morning I got the notification that the controller needed to be charged. Seemed a bit soon, but I just set the Vita as controller 1 and played Contrast and Blacklight with no problems. Remote Play also works great, so far I played Resogun and Warframe on the Vita. I'm in a 2000 square foot house, and there was only one area (living room) that I got connection errors. I really like the new controller, it feels great, looks great, but the battery life is a bit short. Also, I don't like the fact that I can't use my Sony 7.1 wireless headset with this console, but I've got a halfway decent wired headset I plug in to the controller. The included mono headset is a joke. Overall, I'm happy with the system, but I look forward to future firmware updates that will hopefully add features and compatibility.

The battery lasts less than the DualShock 3, but it's a great controller!The only real problem so far with the console is the lack of games released so far...

  This console is great. Everything works quick on it, from downloads to installs to loading. It is small, quiet, and doesn't seem to generate a lot of heat. The only problem I  can notice with it, is the battery on the controller seems relatively small; I've used it for a week now and two controllers have required recharging.I'm not going to dock any stars but shipping from amazon was pretty poor on amazon's part. I could see why so many ps4 systems were having problems, the box they shipped them in could easily have fit 2.5 or 3 consoles. And on top of that, the air pillows for packing were put on top and to the side of the system as opposed to around the product. With the fragility of electronics like this, this seems like it was quite a poor way of doing it as the system would absorb all the shocks and bumps during shipping rather than the bubble wrap. My system was fine, but the ps4 box was very scuffed and scratched on the bottom.

  No problems, very impressive.  Received mine today and set everything up, installed the update and the system seems to be working fine.  Played a downloaded game for an hour or so.  Will update the review if anything changes, but all is good right now.  I was really nervous because of the reports of problems, so I was extra careful and inspected the HDMI plugs and port when I was setting up, and also used a LAN connection, rather than wireless.  As most have reported, the graphics are spectacular, and I love the new controller (especially because I can plug in my fancy earphones).  Note that to use headphones through the controller you have to go to audio settings and send all sound there.  Comes with a code for a 30-day trial of PS+ and another code for a $10 credit toward your PS wallet (downloadable games, movies, etc.).

  I have been enjoying this device since day one. I even started recording my gaming sessions something I have never done before. They make it so easy to do. The system is a nice format, I bought the camera as an add on so I can do the voice control. I would say its a nice to have but definitely not needed. I do like the new controller and I am excited to see more companies use it. Bungie's destiny uses the light bar to flash red when your close to death, and it glows bright orange when you big power is charged and ready. The control has night weight to it and I am looking forward to how its other features will be taken advantage of.Cannot wait for playstation TV so I can enjoy my PS4 in the bedroom when I get booted off the big tv by the misses.

  I love the console, it is sleek, lightning fast, the O.S. is superb and of course a whole step ahead the now ancient PS3 OS.There are no games actually using all the PS4 power at it's finest just yet, but a bright future is coming so embrace yourselfs!I understand that to provide a great multiplayer experience, Sony can't keep everybody under free servers. Having the option tho isgood, just like with the PS3, here as you probably know, expect to pay a premium subscription that it is supposed to pay for itself withthe monthly freebies. To me those free games for us Plus members are crap.The new controller feels really good and I like it a lot more that the old six axxis. Only problem I find is that battery doesn't last longer.Anyway, if you are like me and been with playstation since their first console, you just have to upgrade, easy as that and keep the good times coming. You really don't need any other excuse.Have fun!

  I consider the PS 3 to be, perhaps, the most perfect entertainment device ever conceived. Sony's ad campaign from a couple of years ago was ""It Only Does Everything"" and that was pretty much truth in advertising. I used the PS3 as a multimedia hub for my household. A fully functional and updateable Blu-Ray player, with excellent DVD upscaling, and an unrivaled streaming device for Netflix, Amazon Video, Vudu, Hulu, PlayOn and others. A CD player as well, for rare occasions when a playing a physical disc was required. With the addition of a $20 bluetooth remote, this device was the seamless center of my home entertainment system. I expected the vaunted next generation console to possess the same functionality. Strangely this did not happen. While technically, the PS 4 can still do most of those things, it does so quite unspectacularly and with an interface so clunky that I have been forced to leave my PS3 connected.

  The system is worth the entry price based off the launch lineup alone.  Killzone: Shadowfall and Resogun are easy choices to buy at launch not to mention the criminally underrated Knack.  Games like inFamous: Second Son, Watch Dogs, Drive Club, and Destiny are due in 2014 so don't expect a post-launch drought.  Sony got it right with this system.

  Things to keep in mind with this review.  I have both a ps3, a ps4, and an xbox.  Along with a Nintendo 3dsxl, and a PS vita, iphone, iphone, droid, all of which are great gaming machines in their own right.Pros*Graphics are absolutely fantastic.  I have the ps3 and the ps4 sitting side by side and by far the ps4 has the better graphics.*Ease of use - This thing is fast, like super fast.  There is a marked difference between loading games for the ps3 and the ps4.  and also that sweet little home button on the remote means that mutli tasking is a reality!  You can play a game, hit the home button and do other cool stuff without losing progress on the current game.  You cant have two games running at once which while not fun makes sense.*Fast- did I mention how fast this thing is?*The controller is much more comfortable in hand than the old one.*This goes along with fast but it deserves a separate mention; getting into and out of the PSN store takes just a few seconds!  On the PS3 it can take several minutes to log in and start looking at things, and it takes way to long to just get back out to the homescreen.Cons*backwards compatibility - I have lots of games for the ps3 that I really wish would work with the ps4.  I don't like having both plugged in and having to switch between machines for my 5 year old who has 6 lego games on the ps3.*The controller battery does not last long enough.  Not even almost really.  I have to plug it in almost every other day if not daily.  The ps3 controller is good for 3-4 days.*not enough games yet.  Backwards compatibility would really help on this front.

  I originally got a PS2 10 years ago and then for an odd reason of peer pressure, I chose an Xbox 360 for that generation. I was never really into Microsoft as I felt Sony had better exclusives and a better experience. I would get caught getting stuck playing MLB 2K when I could be playing the show. Halo was good but I would miss out on great exclusives like Infamous and Uncharted. I was going to finally get a PS3 until this. When I heard the PS4 was coming out I was super happy knowing that I would soon be a Sony gamer once again. I have never looked back. Games like Infamous: Second Son, MLB 14: The Show and Resogun all make me happy to be back where I originally was. The PS4 is getting even better with PlayStation Now coming and being allowed to try out betas like Battlefield Hardline and Destiny something Xbox One doesn't allow. In game content for games are also much better on the PS4. Sure Microsoft has Titanfall and Halo but the exclusives Sony has makes those games very forgettable especially with Titanfall 2 likely coming out on both consoles. To sum it all up, the PS4 is a great console and with so many things being added in the future, I don't see Xbox even coming close to the greatness of the PS4.

  Sony seriously outdone themselves with this console. I've owned every console they have came out with and this one is by far the best. I can't wait for the next generation after this.

  As a gaming machine, the Playstation 4 is a wonderful piece of hardware. The graphics are great, and will only get better in time. The Dualshock 4 is a tremendous improvement over the Dualshock 3 in a lot of ways, and anyone familiar with the XMB on the PS3 or PSP should get the hang of the new OS pretty easily. It has some cool features, like the ability to snap back and forth between whatever game you are playing and whatever else you want to do, from looking at your trophies to playing with the web browser.The remote play function with PS Vita is absolutely amazing if you own one, I have a terrible internet connection and it runs smoothly even for me. It's a great option if someone else needs the TV for any other reason.However, I've already encountered a number of issues with the system, most of them having to do with other features (or lack thereof) than playing games. For starters, not only was the ability to play media from a USB taken away, you cannot even download movies or TV shows you buy on the PSstore anymore. You have to stream them. That means if the PSN goes down for any reason or you are without an internet connection for any reason, you cannot watch your movies or TV shows you paid for, although the system does play Blu-Rays and DVDs. At this time the system cannot play MP3s, though Sony said that ability will be patched in eventually.Also, there is currently no way to pause downloads. That might not be a problem for people with a fast internet connection without a bandwith cap, but for myself I can only have one game on the list at a time, or else it would take forever to get anything downloaded. It is great that you can play games while others are downloading (most even let you play the game as it downloads, after it gets enough done) and in standby mode though. I just don't see how nobody though of letting you prioritize the downloads or pausing them while the system is on.Sadly, there is only a HDMI hookup in the back, which means if your TV doesn't have an HDMI port, you won't be able to use the system. I don't know why Sony would want to alienate customers who have to use component or composite hookups.While I love the Dualshock 4 for the most part, the light bar can be frustrating as there is no way to turn it off. If you are playing a dark game than the light can be seen reflecting off of the screen.There is currently no way to personalize your homescreen, so even if you don't use Sony's Music or Video unlimited services, there's no way to remove their icons. I would love to change the background from the blue swirls to a picture of my choice, like you could do with PS3, PSP, and Vita. Heck, even being able to change the color of the background would be cool.It's possible to fix many of these problems with simple software updates, and hopefully fixes for the light bar on the controller and the ability to pause downloads come soon. I'd imagine that themes for the PS4 homescreen will eventually go on sale too.I don't think a fix that allows you to download the media you bought on the PSstore to PS4 is coming, but hopefully I'm wrong.

  It was all ok except the hand held controller did not work.  The only way we could get the controller replaced was to unhook the entire playstation, put it back in the box and ship it back to the sender!

  I bought my PS4 a month after it was released and I have not regretted it at all. It's a step up from the PS3 and in my opinion, is slightly better than the XBOne although not by much. Below are my thoughts.Pro's:1) The controllers are comfortable to hold unlike the XBOne or 360.2) The Blu-Ray player is reliable and quickly loads movies3) The Ethernet internet is fast at downloading updates and watching streaming movies/shows4) The system as a whole is very reliable thus far and I have barely experienced at problems at all. Most problems come from the games themselves.Con's:1) The battery time on the controller is abysmal at best. I play maybe 30 minutes a day and a full charge might last me 3 days at best (1.5 hour total gameplay) before I have to recharge it. I bought an extra controller so I could just swap out in a hurry. This has been a constant problem since the PS4 was released.2) Games are slow being released but that is expected of every new system.3) The hardware is at least 2 generations or more behind current limits but again, that's typical for consoles. Both the PS4 and XBOne were dated technology before either was released.

  If you are really into console gaming, you already have all the systems. If you aren't, and are just a casual gamer or looking to buy one system for your kids, the PS4 is the one to get.Why the PS4 over Xbox One? Power, features, and price.Even though the Xbox One will now be $400 without Kinect, the PS4 is still a more powerful system at the same price. Whenever games are multi-platform, I usually buy them on PS4 over the Xbox One because of this.I also feel Sony provides better value in their online system. The free games you get each month on PS+ are actually pretty good, where the games MS provides are usually older and less exciting.If you only want one system, this is the one to get.

  impressed with the hardware, dissapointed with the game library.lets face it, everyone knows this is superior than the xbox one.but what good is having better hardware when the game library just plain LACKS?i'm playing diablo 3 (yes i still enjoy this better than every other game for the ps4).i play a little bit of bloodborne and that's about it.everything else is indie games and remaster versions of old games.i think this generation of consoles shouldn't have been released just yet.the ps3 and xbox360 are great systems still and the game libraries are full of AAA titles and also both systems are superb media content players.in contrast the PS4 and xboxone only have less than 10 AAA titles. it's mostly indie and remaster games, both of which i refuse to pay money for.at it's current state, i cannot recommend either this or the xbox one due to not having much to play.

  I have both ps4 & xbox1 ps4 games run at 60 frames per second xbox 30, you would not even notice the difference. Other than that they both need at least 1 terabyte of space on their hard drives. And the only negative I can say about the ps4 is that the controllers battery does not last long due to the lighting on it and the cords to recharge are still way to short compared to Xbox 1 or the 360 again small things but I feel they should have been improved on given the fact that it is supposed to be the next gen console.

  What else can be said about the Playstation 4 that hasn't already been said by countless video game websites by now? Before I begin my product review, I will start with an Amazon Disclaimer: I purchased this product new through Amazon at launch, so I can't share any insight on whether this particular *current* listing is selling refurbished/used/etc items by now or not - which some reviews seem to imply.  That being said though, my system is still working flawlessly, and the PS4 is an extremely powerful machine.If you're a gamer and looking for the best current gen system, you'd be hard pressed not to go with Sony this time around!  And this comes from a video game aficionado who's been gaming since I could hold a controller, and a (still) hardcore Xbox 360 user.GREAT GAMES = Sony has always been a quality first party company and always provides some awesome system exclusives.  ""God of War"", ""The Last of Us"", ""Bloodborne"", ""Uncharted"".  And probably what is showing some of the most promise?  Sony's indie games collection.  There are some incredible, exclusive gems in their online store, which make games genuinely fun and simple again.  Forget the flash, these are games you can get lost in for hours.  Many third party companies have noticed the changing of the guard as well, and began to hop on board with Sony for exclusives or timed-releases for their games.  And if you don't believe me, check out E3 2015 for how many third parties are receiving Sony's backing and vice versa.  The games collection for PS4 and Xbox One will (for the most part) always be very similar, but now is the time to make the purchase.  There are some fantastic Triple-A titles finally available and more coming soon.GREAT SERVICE = Sure, Sony and Microsoft have had some issues with their online servers, but nothing is perfect.  Playstation Plus is a really fun online service, and is finally up there with Xbox Live.  One of the best features about the PS4 too is the PS NOW service.  For a tiny fee, you can now stream PS3 classic games all you want!  And PS NOW is getting new games and being improved constantly.  While Sony is still perfecting all their additional services, there is great promise with PS Plus, PS Now, and PS Vue.  The good news is that Sony has finally competed with Microsoft with their customer service, and shows no signs of stopping the improvements.POWERFUL CONSOLE = The PS4 is a beast, just as is it's competition, the Xbox One.  HOWEVER - Playstation 4 still has the more powerful graphics card, and while the PS4 only has a slight visual edge right now; there is a day forthcoming where Sony can potential run away with it.  With 4K becoming more popular, this could potentially be where you will notice huge graphic rendering changes.  Bare in mind that PS4 offers a very consistent and solid 1080p experience, while Xbox One mostly upscales the graphics.  As a recent purchaser of a 4K television, I can say first hand the gaming experience with one connected to your PS4 is mind blowing!CONS = Still not as good of an all around media/entertainment device as the Xbox One.  Sony is improving their services though, incorporating live television services, streaming for movies and audio (finally), etc.  But Xbox One came out with this at launch and therefore has the leg up on Sony right now.  Another thing Microsoft has going for it is the Kinect.  Sony just won't be able to match things the Kinect can do.  In Sony's defense, the highly anticipated virtual reality peripheral Project Morpheus is to be released in 2016, and that could be as revolutionary for Sony as the Kinect was for Microsoft.Bottom line, if you're a gamer you are going to love either the Playstation 4 or the Xbox One.  However, I can't see any reason not to purchase a PS4 alongside whatever other console you may have (Wii U, Xbox 360, etc).  You are going to get an incredible gaming experience, and with their streaming service finally becoming competitive, it's becoming an amazing entertainment and media center as well.  The games (especially those phenomenal indies!) however are what's making Sony run away with the console wars this time around, just as they did with the Playstation 2.  Going back to their roots, and for good reason!EDITOR'S NOTE: To the trolls down voting every 5-star review for no reason: the PS4 retail price has recently dropped by $50, so maybe you can ask your parents to get it for you now so you can get off Amazon for a change.

  Honestly this is the farthest thing from a perfect consol. There aren't many games, not many apps, the camera doesn't come with it and doesn't do much.Now for something positiveThe potential for this consol is insane to think about. Sony just released that it will be able to RENT games. Then there's the news of ""playstation now"" which will basically be the netflix of games. Besides Titanfall and Halo, every game announced soo far is pretty much on both consoles so the decision shouldn't be based on exclusive games.Sony has a lot in store for the PS4 but I beleive they plan to release it in increments to keep the price from decreasing (just as xbox has done). Another words, you probably shouldn't wait for the price to go down because it will be a few years.If none of this helped your decision, look at the specs and the cost.

  I was very nervous about my PS4.My friend got his from Amazon few hours before me and his did not work.  So every time the screen went black during the update I thought it was the end.  BUT, I am pleased to say mine works like a champ.  I won’t go into what the system does or doesn’t do because that has been said many times over.  I love the system for it does, which is play games and it does that very well.  Everything else it does just adds to my enjoyment.The one thing really nobody talks about much and I really like is the speaker on the DS4.  I know that a small thing but it’s pretty cool. I hope more developers use in the future.BTW – My friend got his to work after doing some troubleshooting.  He left it unplugged for a few hour and when he turning it back on, it worked.

  I'm gonna go Good/Bad/Good/Bad.Good console but the UI is crap. Crap sprinkled with garbage. We should have the option to turn off that annoying home screen music too. Still, I don't regret it at all. PS Plus has wonderful games and They added a Crunchyroll app early on, which XB1 still doesn't have. Then again XB1 has a Youtube app (Hint Hint Sony). The Packaging was also terrible, when compared to the immaculate box the XB1 came in. Obviously the Blu-Ray player is Top Notch. The battery life on controllers is the worst I've ever seen, FIX THIS SONY! Or at least put a better one on the market (a couple hours is UNACCEPTABLE). The Ability to rent games is Epic, though the prices are inflated for better games. There should be a standard price IMO. Way better selection than on XB1. But the PSN area is not pretty to look at...X-bar was better than this (I guess that's UI again, but it really is bad).The Specs are better than XB1. Not enough to make a difference in any game I've seen, but XB1 should have went with the better RAM, Good decision here by SONY. The Camera is crap in my opinion, but you don't have to buy it (This did not influence my review, just saying). Also, having to download, THEN apply updates for the console/games is tedious and unnecessary. I can see why some people would want it, but there should be an option to just DO IT. HDD size is way too small, both systems did this. Look at the size of install files. Especially Destiny. No way that's gonna be viable.The new lending system is cool, playing a game a friend owns with them. One negative comment about that though, no saved progress is LAME as hell. How about locking saves, giving you the option of buying the game later?Basically if you're a Sony fan, you'll love this system anyway. Anybody else, you'll still like it alot. Far from perfect so far, but if/when they address my gripes I'll update my rating. Fixing the UI alone would probably change it to a 5.

  the ps4 is a powerhouse for the 1st time I can run battlefield just like I do on my pc and being able to go into the main menu and browse catch up with friends or download something without shutting down the game you are playing is great just press the ps button do what you have to do then click the game again and its right where you left off and if you're playing online it continues until you come back into the game ,sharing is a breeze and luckily I have not had the issues of some users I see with ps4 & bf4 issues I see online I bought the day one edition nov 15 and no problems so I'm happy plus all of the free games you get via download with ps+ are pretty good no heat issues or noise its cool and quiet unlike my boosted oc radeon hd 7950 in my pc but I run the fan at 75% so its to be expected

  I was worried with so many getting dead consoles from Amazon.  However, mine worked and it is great.  Many reviews will outline the features and such.  I will tell you one of the first things I did was upgrade to a 1TB hard drive to handle the excessive storage demands.  The process was super easy and took me about 15 minutes total (including software updates).  All you need is a screwdriver and thumb drive.  The process is easy and Sony has clear directions since they seem to encourage buyers to upgrade.  I recommend everyone do that right away, before you get too much on the original hard drive.Pros: Just about everything.Cons: Amazon packing really left something to be desired.  Also, having to invest in a hard drive right away stinks.  Since they don't support USB, you can't just put it off until you need it or you will run into a headache moving content to a new hard drive.

  Received the PS4 on launch day and unfortunately had received one of the units that would not boot (blue light blink only.)  Numerous attempts to reach Sony (chat was busy or would drop, phone hold was LONG) over the weekend did result in some frustration and I was ready to ship back to Amazon.  (which was willing to accept and has always been easy to do) However, I decided to give Sony one more chance.  Monday I was able to talk with someone within 10 minutes and after some troubleshooting it was determined they needed to replace.  Sony overnighted a box for return with paid overnight return - long story short - got my PS4 back from Sony within a week (Thanksgiving included.)The PS4 looks like it will be an amazing replacement for my PS3.  Battlefield 4 and FIFA 14 are GREAT and COD:Ghosts is good for the same console co-op (Why don't more game developers understand that some of us still want to have friends over and play!)  The graphic potential of the PS4 can be seen at various times in the above three games, especially BF4.  The sound is great.  The new interface is VERY fast although it takes a little bit to get used to.  The update process for everything is easy (it basically can do it automatically for you.) Having to have a PSN Plus subscription was disappointing at first but then I picked a one year subscription on Black Friday at Amazon for $30 and have gotten my moneys worth in less then 10 days with the free games that I've downloaded and played.  The new DualShock controllers are a nice improvement over the last edition without changing too much (the light hasn't bothered us to this point.)  I've connected to the PS4 via my android phone and an iPad although i don't have any games taking advantage of the second screen functionality, it connected very easily and look forward to this being used.  I've used the ancillary apps for BF4 and COD:Ghosts on the iPad and they are decent but not game changing - yet!!  Looking forward to trying a PS Vita with this and AC4 and Killzone come Christmas as it appears that the AC4 app will truly add some nice additional functionality to the game play (map and navigation.)  Why only 4 stars?  I can deal with being unlucky and getting a ""brick"" as they replaced it - I just want to be able to play some of my PS3 games!!!  I hope Sony can deliver in 2014 with Gaikai?!?  Then it will be a 5 star platform!!

  Very powerful console, interface is amazing, it takes a fraction of a second to go from any game to the PS4 XMB.You can quickly notice how stunning the new graphics are, even in games like Fifa, the difference between the PS3 and the PS4 is really really noticeable.The package even comes with an HDMI cable, which is really nice! So you have everything you need out of the box, no more runnings to the supermarket to get an HDMI cable.Also the new controller has a great feel in your hands, its a little more bigger than the DS3 but way more comfortable, the touchpad is really responsive.I can't wait to see Infamous 3 or Watch Dogs!

  My ps4 arrived in great working condition. I swapped out the 500gb HDD with a seagate 1tb sshd for the boost in capacity and speed, and I'm happy with the result.My biggest reason for purchasing the ps4 was the remote play function used with the handheld ps vita. Games on the ps4 can be streamed over wifi to the vita, freeing up the tv for other viewers. This was perfect for my married life. My wife can watch her favorite shows(which I have zero interest in) while I pillage and plunder the Caribbean seas in AC4 (Aarrrrggh, matey!!!), all without having to retreat to a man-cave! It works with very few hiccups and very beautiful graphics! I was even able to successfully use remote play on LTE over 80 miles from home! Greatness!If you find yourself lacking the time to be able to play console games on your TV in your adult life, the ps4 (coupled with the ps vita) can reunite you with the joys of console quality gaming!

  The console----------------ProsGraphics looks great, even for launch titles.Very small form factor.Twitch Streaming works very well.Upgradable hard drive.ConsCan get noisy when BluRay drive is reading a disc.  Fans seem a bit louder than my PS3 slim.Bundled mic and headset are really cheap.No HD stream option for Twitch.No wireless AC (not an issue for me, but may be for some people)HDD only 500GB.  If you plan on going all digital you'll probably need to upgrade the drive at some point.No support for external storage.No DLNA or MP3 support.The UI--------ProsNavigating the PSN store is much quicker.Navigation throughout the UI is very quick.  Even jumping to the menu from a game is fast.Viewing your trophies is much quicker.Integration with smartphone app is nice, lets you use your phone as a keyboard to input text.ConsNo way to sort or organize your games.No way to delete unused apps from the UI.No way to pause a download.The Controller-------------------ProsController is much improved from the Dual Shock 3.  Better sticks, better triggers.Plug headphones directly into the controller.ConsCan't manually turn off your controller to save battery while watching a movie.No way to turn off the light bar on the controller.Battery life on the controller could be better.Console needs to be in standby to charge the controllers.Charging cable is short.  It's not going to reach your couch. You'll need a USB extension cable.Final Thoughts---------------Overall I'm pleased with my purchase.  Most of my cons are minor issues that don't detract too much from my overall enjoyment of the console.  Some of the things can be fixed in future updates, but I have to rate the console as it stands now.I've played Killzone, Need for Speed Rivals and Resogun.  All look beautiful and much improved over the PS3/360 era.  I'd say the graphics are on par with my high end gaming PC.  I expect the games will only look better as time goes on.  Probably the best launch lineup for a system ever.  Wide variety of games, but very few exclusives.  A lot of the launch titles are on PS3/Xbox/WiiU, so there's not much of a rush to get a new system yet.  You can probably wait until Spring/Summer when titles like Infamous and Destiny come out.On launch day the PSN was down quite a bit, but that's expected when thousands of people are trying to connect at the same time.  I was able to load the 1.50 firmware on a USB stick and use the system despite the PSN being down for periods of time on the 15th.  Since then everything has been running smooth.  I upgraded to the 1.51 firmware via the console's updater and it worked fine.Thoughts on Amazon's shipping----------------------------------------My PS4 arrived via UPS.  The box was fairly large, about 3 times taller than the console's box.  The console was on the bottom of the box and there was packing air pads on top of it.  I'm guessing those are just there to keep the PS4 box from moving around inside the Amazon box during shipping.  It seems like it would have made more sense to put some of those air pads under the PS4 to provide some protection during shipping.  I know that UPS has a tendency to actually drop packages on my porch.  There was also a hole in the side of my Amazon box, right where the PS4 was positioned.  It looks like someone kicked the box.I'm guessing Sony's packaging for the PS4 should be good enough to protect it during shipping.  However, that box is very small, and doesn't seem to protect it very much.

  Absolutely cannot believe the way it was packaged. No padding what so ever, just the factory PlayStation box inside a cardboard box 1 1/2 times its size and a piece of paper layer over the top. I am amazed it functions without issue

  I had a lot of debate at first of which console to buy. But I always leaned toward the PS4. Mainly I could upgrade the hard drive right away. It is more powerful than its competitor, it can play games in 1080p. If you have TV that can use that which I do.It really upgrades the dash board from the PS3. The PS4 is so effortless.  I know exactly what I am looking for on there and know how to find it right away.Right now the only thing hurting both systems is the lack of Next Gen games. But maybe after E3 that will change and some new games will be shown and things will expand.If you want to get a PS4, I'd wait till about October when some of the newer games are coming out. But if you really a diehard Next Gen player and want to play Watch Dogs on the PS4 then make sure you get before May 27th.

  This was a Christmas present for our 15yr old son and he has been extremely pleased with it since the time he opened the package. He has upgraded from his original PS2 Slim through now the PS4 and found hundreds of hours of entertainment all along the way. He tells me his favorite feature on the new game system is the headphone jack on the controller which allows him to use the same headphones that he uses on his iPhone to play games without disturbing anyone around him. This feature also works for Blu-ray playback and has proven very beneficial during the many snow days watching movies and playing games.

  hoping this is the second batch of ps4 to avoid the malfunctions the first systems had. I have a been a playstation fan since day one and the picture is so clear and the controller is the best user friendly controller on the market. The games are coming along slowly but it is all crisp and beautiful.

  This is the console generation where Sony got it's mojo back. During the last generation, it felt like Sony was largely playing catch up with the features of Xbox Live and the Xbox in general. The PS4 has eliminated the gap and shot slightly ahead in terms of raw technical specs. Virtually gone is the move controller and any integration with motion control. This console focuses on gaming and it largely succeeds.Pros:1. Big step up in graphics from the PS3.2. Overall better specs with a 500gb hard drive to handle increasingly chunkier game updates and downloads.3. The Playstation Network is finally ready for prime time. (even if it's frequently getting attacked)4. New controller adds functionality through slight evolution.5. Integrated movie capture mode that allows you to save the last 15 minutes of game play with the push of 2 buttons.6. Integration has been added to share your accomplishments via social media like Facebook and YouTube.7. Ever increasing game library.Cons:1. Hard drive could be bigger.2. There is no way to be online without all of your PSN friends seeing your online status.3. No backward compatibility with PS3 games.I would highly recommend this game console.

  I have had my PS4 for roughly four months now. My first Sony product, as I have been(still am) an avid 360 fan. I basically preferred the number of games in my favorite genre coming for this The systems works and has continued to work flawlessly. No, ""blue light of death"". Nothing like I suffered through with my first four(yes four) 360 systems. The 360 works great now. My point is, first year new tech items have their litter ""runts"", put trust in the company to resolve and improve. Sony has created an excellent gaming console. 1080p looks fantastic. The controller is very good, not great. The ""option"" button being in odd place being my main complaint. All the other buttons and triggers feel quite sturdy and their overall placement works well. I agree with other reviews in that the battery is short, have not timed it, but I seem to always have to charge it.  My current apps, Netflix, and Amazon prime are far and away better then the last gen. They load quicker, and the bump to 1080p is very impressive. Even Colombo looks clear and defined. Not a huge fan of the PSN just feels..""clunky"" yeah ""clunky"".  The future games outlook appears to be great. This system will really shine with some fantastic games, after all that is its sole purpose. some truly fantastic games.

  So after a few months of owning my PS4 I only have one issue and that is with the controller. It is comfortable but after many hours of playing NBA 2k14 I noticed the rubber coating on the left thumb stick wore out. Now it feels flat and I can feel the rubber moving on the stick. Other than that I like what games I have played  and am waiting for the PS4 game catalogue to grow.

  I had my PS4 for about 4 days and then it became unusable. I was unfortunate to get a PS4 that crashed. But my review is still that this system is great. The few days I was able to play, I had a blast. The PS4 is an amazing piece of technology and extremely fun to play on. If you end up like me and yours breaks, call Sony Support and they will be happy to send you a replacement free of charge. That's what I did and I should be receiving my new PS4 within 3 days. They are sending me a box with overnight shipping so I can send the broken PS4 back. They put overnight shipping on that and once that gets back, they will send the new PS4 to me also with overnight shipping. The system is new and of course there will be some that have bugs or become unusable. I chose not to write a bad review because I understand that these things happen with new technology. The PS4 may have a few bugs varying by console to console, but it is still the best gaming system I've ever had the privilege to play on. Just because you may get a system that breaks, that should not change your opinion of the console. Sony is great about keeping their customers satisfied. Like I said, they will send you back a brand new console for absolutely no cost to you if you happen to get one that breaks.

  PS4 came in on time and was in good shape when received. Had to send unit in for repair because of the disk drive not working. After being online with Sony, they shipped me a return box, repaired/replaced unit and sent back. The new unit is working like the first one should have worked. Only reason for the four star rating is due to the issues with the original unit. Not an issue from the seller.

  This is probably the most comfortable gaming machine I've ever experienced.  It's quick and simple to get into the game you want to play and doesn't really require technical know how.  Streaming, sharing video and screenshots is a button press away.  The controller has a standard headphone jack that can work for ear-bud and microphone style communication or output the game audio.  Sony really has raised the bar for ""gamer-centric"" features.As of the date of writing this, there are only a handful of really meaningful exclusives so it is a bit hard to recommend to anyone who has a decent gaming PC.  I realize this is subjective, but most of the interesting games available on the PSN store are available on Steam and often cheaper and better supported.Another downside is that you must purchase a Playstation Plus subscription to use many online features of the games.  I have found this greatly balanced by the frequent Plus exclusive sales and giveaways.  A Plus subscription also allows you backup saves on the cloud and update games while the playstation is resting.  It's worth noting that these are all features that are essentially free on a service such as Steam.If you're looking for a simple and powerful gaming machine and don't want to fiddle with a PC, this is probably a great purchase.  For people with a gaming machine, it's likely a pass without at least one game that you really must have.

  I received this on launch day and was extremely excited to start playing. I plugged it in, started it up, did my update, and was ready to pop a disc in. And then I received an error. It said my disc wasn't recognized. I tried another disc, and then a DVD, and then a Blu Ray. Nothing worked. Same error every time. I scoured the forums and found a few people having the same issue, but mostly complaints about the BLOD. Also, it seemed that a large majority of the people having problems had ordered the launch edition from Amazon like myself. I found a few troubleshooting tips and tried them all with no help. I called Sony customer support. I had to wait on hold for over two hours which was pretty annoying, but I wasn't incredibly angry about it since it was launch day. Once a representative finally came on the phone they were very helpful, walked me through a few more things, and then gave me no trouble about sending out a box to return it. They also told me I could go to my local Sony store to have it replaced and that I could just disregard the box they were sending me if I managed to have it done there. I was able to go to Sony the next day and they gave me no hassle at all, immediately handed me a new unit and apologized for the inconvenience. A few other customers were in the store as well with the BLOD problem, and all reported that their unit had come from Amazon. Once I got it home, it works great so far. There aren't a lot of exclusives available yet, but I have always been more of a platformer, indie, and JRPG player than shooter/sports/action, and that was my primary reason for getting a PS4 over XBone. My rating of the system is a 4/5, one star off for the current lack of games. However, I will never purchase a launch date console from Amazon ever again... if at all.

  I was holding off buying a next gen console until there was a game worth buying, and boy, was it worth it. I have not regretted buying this console for a single minute. Every game that I've played for it so far has been amazing. InFamous: Second Son alone totally justifies buying the console.

I love this system, it needs more games ASAP, and would be the launches only complaint.

  Would not regret to upgrade. Much better graphics, more players more fun - well, if you play battlefield 4 like me, get ready to mess with your K/D in the beginning. 64 player is way different than 24. bullets everywhere. Also, a complaint to the game not console, is they change the trigger button from R1 to R2 and cannot change back by setting. The R2 design on this has a long travel (which might simulate the long travel trigger?), but the reset on it is way too long. You have to release the button to trigger next shot. This make pistol battle less ideal since you will constantly has ""misfire"" due to the reset issue, it is not the lag dude. I thought it was the lag but not.

  A very impressive release from Sony.  Definite improvements over the PS3 both hardware wise and software wise. I found the PS3 user interface bland and not well laid out. The PS4 has improved that and it is much simpler to use and navigate around. Not perfect, but I suspect this will get better in future updates.The games look and play great. Sony push for Indy titles on the PS4 is going to be a boost for them. Playing games like Resogun and Contrast for free (if you have PS+) at launch is awesome. Killzone looks great.No real stability problems short of one lock up before the 1.5.1 update when I was installing DC Universe.  Had to pull power for that lock up. Holding in power for an eternity wouldn't fix things.  Powered off and on and was back up and installing the rest of DC Universe.Controller feels great, although a full charge only seems to last about 7-8 hours.  But that isn't terrible.Disappointed hdcp is active on games and user interface. Would like to be able to capture video over HDMI. Supposedly this is coming in a patch.  Also wish twitch streaming supported archiving on twitch for easy export to YouTube or downloading.All and all though the PS4 is a great buy if you are looking for a next gen console.

  I have a friend who has had nothing but issues with his and is beyond frustrated. I was able to set ours up with no issues and got into the games just fine. You do have to pay to play games online now unlike with the past Playstations but a 30 Day trial of Playstation Plus is included and you get some free content as well.The graphics and sound are great and I love using the touchpad in game. The only issues I have had so far are due to Network issues as downloading games has been a pain. I got into Warframe yesterday and had a great solo and online match but was unable to get back in later due to network issues which also stalled my other downloads.I am sure there will be a few updates this week but being able to get four solid games for free from their online shop and the huge amount of titles in tv, movies, and games that you can get is great.  I also liked the ability to share my content to Facebook and stream with no issues.

  To begin with, PS4 was very difficult to buy. Amazon received some stock from time to time but minutes later they were already gone. I bought mine in January and received it within 3 days.The console itself is great - the looks, the way it works, etc. One of the things I like the most is the ability to plug in your headphones directly to DS4.No 'blue light of death' so far :) (some people experienced this problem during the first couple of hours of using PS4) - I've been playing AC4 for about 40-50h now.Overall, I'm very satisfied with my purchase

  I'm really liking the system, the UI is responsive and easy to navigate. The controller feels heftier and the triggers are awesome, major improvement on the triggers on the DS3. I've been enjoying the games and feel there is a lot of variety on the games available at launch, there are sports games, 1 racing game (NFS), several shooters, open worlders (ACIV), F2P's, indies, there's a ton of stuff available to play. My 2 favorite games so far are KZ:SF and RESOGUN. Overall I believe the PS4 to be a great system and the launch lineup of games are in my opinion really solid.

  Soon as I got the package on the day of release that afternoon. I noticed that Amazon had cushioned the box inside to protect my investment which was a plus. The console itself I made sure to download the firmware and boot into safe mode to flash it to 1.50 before anything else. I didn't trust the OTA firmware update because the PSN was having intermittent connection issues. So far playing on and off since Friday I love the system and going back and forth out of game to the other services is fast.However what the PS3 has in terms of options it was taken a step back with the PS4. System options to the console is very bare in terms of customizing what you need compared to the PS3. When they say are going back to just gaming this time they really mean it. Not much in terms of multimedia except those apps that you can download from PSN or what you have as blu-rays. I'm sure this will expand as we continue to push forward.Why I gave it 5 stars is because for me I'm using this as a gaming device and not so much as multimedia that some would also use it as. Also to note that the fan can ramp up during gameplay so if you decide to purchase a PS4 later on when they are available, make sure you have a lot of space. The Dual Shock 4 controller feels extremely nice and the trigger pull on R2 and L2 are very light. My hand doesn't hurt at all unlike the DS3 when pressing the triggers for long periods of time.

  The PS4 is a very impressive piece of hardware, and heralds Sony's return to the front ranks of the video game market, but the launch edition is not without its share of glitches.I can report that I too experienced problems with the HDMI out on the console. I initially saw a black screen. After plugging and unplugging the HDMI connection, and turning off the console a few times, the picture popped back on, but it would go black and come back on over and over.I eventually tried another  HDMI cable I had laying around, and that worked just fine. No problem since. But it is clear that the issue is the console's HDMI port, which seems poorly made and prone to glitches. I hope it behaves from now on.The console itself is as advertised. It is a sleek, small, visually impressive little console that seems to have been elegantly designed. It is fairly quiet and does not emit a lot of heat.I already replaced the hard drive in favor of a larger unit, which was as easy as pulling back the cover with my hands and unscrewing four phillips head screws. This is something many will want to do, as hard drive space fills up quickly.The console, like the PS3, still takes forever to load new games because it uses the hard drive to stream the data, but once gameplay begins it is very smooth and visually impressive.The biggest knock on the hardware design is probably the tiny off/on button and eject button in the front. These are almost microscopic and a real pain to use at first. But fortunately you can use the controller to power off the console.All in all I would highly recommend the console, but be forewarned that you may have to deal with some glitches/patches if you buy the launch edition. This is par for the course with a new console launch, but it bears mention to those who would rather not deal with this kind of aggravation to test out the latest tech. Such people likely will want to wait a few months.

  If you hated the PS3 you will love the PS4.  The console does an excellent job staying out of your way by self-managing all downloads and installs.  Game installs take less than a minute and will continue while playing the game.  It is really easy and fast jumping from game to game.  It takes the frustrations out of the equation by jumping right into your game with very short launch times.  PSVita Remote Play works flawlessly including my test of having the PS4 in NJ and the PSVita in NYC.Now on to the bad parts.  500GB isn’t going to last long.  I have replaced mine with a HTGC 1TB 7,200RPM HDD.  I have filled 1/5th the 500GB drive or 1/10th the 1TB drive.  For the average consumer this will be an issue.  The Console’s System Software can be buggy at times.  I have had the PS4 lock up during a Remote Play session and required someone to physically unplug it remotely.  PSN has a lot of hiccups during the first week of system launch.  Music Unlimited is a horrible service.  Has issues with slow load speeds, stopping music randomly and very poor UI.  Sony is releasing an update that will MP3 and CD support.  This will remove the need for Music Unlimited.  Wish Sony would work with Spotify or rdio to make a PS4 compatible app.  I don’t see why they can’t since Netflix competes with Video Unlimited service.The games come very close to PC capable graphics.  This is coming from a person who owns a GTX 690 and can run all PC games at max settings.Overall highly recommend the PS4 I have a feeling that this will be the rebirth of the PS2 era.

I like that it comes with a little headset mic, the design is slick and it runs quietly when its turned on. The controller is a much better improvement over the dualshock 3 controller and has some neat features built into it like a speaker and a touchpad. The PS4 runs very fast and plays smoothly no matter what is being played or what app. Remote play is awesome and works fast and easy, I was very impressed with this feature and thought it was a cool thing to have. Ever good system I recommended it.

  Excellent gaming performancePS Vita Remote Play over WiFiAlright, the stuff that truly matters. The PlayStation 4 is indeed a graphical step up from the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360. The games look very good, and everything loads quite quickly. Beyond the speedy, one time install when you first pop in a new game, it's hard to even notice the loading times. There's nothing that even comes close to the disconcertingly long load up of the PS3's The Last of Us.The graphics are good, but not mind blowing. If you've played on a PC that costs two or three times what a PS4 goes for, you've seen as good, if not slightly better.(im a pc gamer and i see big diference between both still pc rules )Sony gave away online multiplayer for free with the PlayStation 3, but you could opt for PlayStation Plus status for digital store discounts and other perks. Now the arrival of the PS4, Sony has given the PSN a major renovation, and introduced a paywall for online multiplayer.(which it sucks that you have to play for multiplayer)nevertheless enjoy this device , and the most interesting line up comes from Sony's own studios which make top quality games

  PS4 is awesome. The controller, although interesting with PS move built in and a touch screen, is well designed. The console itself is great and the only issue is figuring how to turn it on for the first time.(seriously the power button is the size of a toothpick) There aren't many games out for it, however Sony has compensated with a few free games and demos you can pick up on the store. Definitely good to buy, just expect a few minor software errors that comes with it being a new console.

  The only reason I'm not giving a solid 5 star yet is because I am still waiting to see how future games play...but so far, it's very slick.I'm sure by the time new games come out,that really take advantage of the technology, I'll be singing the 5 star praises.As many have said here... I love the controller. It fits my hands like second-skin. The camera works well but still waiting for more games to see what comes from that.I really like the live streaming of games and interacting with other players..again, once more games are released, that feature is going to be sweet. Oh...and the share button is flawless.I've watched some BluRay movies on it and it might be my imagination, but the picture looks even better (Man of Steel looked flipping awesome!). Netflix and all movie apps work just as expected.I like being able to download while other things are happening and having more than one application open at once.I could go on and on with good stuff...the only bad thing for the moment is that there's not enough games-but that'll change. Also, I wish that I could play ps3 games on it--like GTA5.I plan on buying an xbox one as well to have a fair comparison to both systems. I had the 360 as well as the ps3 before and enjoyed both but found myself on ps3 more.I'm looking forward to see what future games and systems updates are like, but so far, this is a fantastic buy.

  The system is very fast and responsive with a clean interface/OS that is easy to use.  The gaming graphics are excellent and better than the PS3 but not outstanding enough to ""wow"" you but I am sure it will in the coming months/years with newer games that can take advantage of the raw power.  Playstation Plus is also a great feature ($50/year) that gives you the capability of online gaming along with free games (select titles of course).  The online gaming works perfectly as I have not experienced any lag or disconnect.  I never used my PS3 for online gaming so I do not know how it is improved but the PS4 online gaming definitely works better than my Xbox 360.  I haven't tried my Xbox One for online gaming yet but that is moot in this review.There are a few things that I do not like about the PS4 that gives it 4 out of 5 stars instead of a perfect score.  The system does not support 3D Blu ray.  I still use my PS3 for that which is fine but you would expect the 3D feature out of the box (with the 1.5 system update) on a newer Sony product.  The system does not recognize my USB 3.0 1TB external hard drive when plugged in.  I have a few 4K demonstrations on the hard drive that I would like to see on my 4K TV but the system does not support external hard drives.  After a ton of research, it turns out that the PS4 does not support 4K video out of the box anyway so my 4K demos wouldn't even display in 4K if the hard drive worked.Also, after about a half hour of game play, the internal fan is blowing at full speed and is seriously loud.  It sounds like a jet from a distance.  I can understand why because the system gets insanely hot.  I mean, the PS4's extremely hot temperature and loud fan noise makes me think that maybe I have a defective unit.  Does anyone who owns a PS4 have the same heating and fan noise issue.  Please let me know.

  Happy with it.  Wish the controller had longer battery life even after changing the setting to dim the light on it.  Sometimes the sound reverses on the speakers - I have all Sony (TV, sound system, PS4).  Doesn't correct itself unless I turn off then back on.

  Fortunately I have no issues with my PS4 other than a certain point (after gaming for 10 hours) in which the video would cut off (I was using headphones). I simply reconnected the HDMI cable and didn't encounter the same problem. The PS4 is a champ. I can't wait until they roll out features such as suspend mode (when you turn on the console it loads straight back to your game).Pros:-Nice and compact.-Appears to be running cool (great cooling system)-The design of the new Dualshock 4 is superb-UI is sleek and smooth-I love the new features to PSN-I haven't experienced any lag in online play.-Live streaming = great idea (thank you sony for the share button)Cons:-Console wobbles a bit (not a huge deal)-Didn't have all of the advertised features available at launch-Blue light of death affecting a few people-Can't turn off the light on the controller when a game doesn't support it-The DS4 has poor battery life-No 3D Blu ray movie support-No MP3/CD/USB support-Forced to upload videos/pictures to Facebook/Twitter. I would appreciate the option to upload it to dropbox so that we can access the material on other devices-As of now there is no customization of the UI.

  I purchased a PS4 because it's the most powerful of the two systems. I want to let people know if you have a very large screen like me, you want a console that can output 1080p at 60 frames plus with no up conversion unlike the other console which I also own. If your a hardcore gamer and want a console focused on games and not media I'd pick the PS4 or buy both like I did. Ps4 is the best playstation console that sony came out with it has similar stuff like the ps3 it has the blu-ray stuff just like the ps3 but its basically better than that u can download games and play them without having to put the disk in its amazing so if i lose my game of fifa i can just play it there now that i just have it downloaded its easy and cool. No description's really needed. It's the newest Playstation system. Used it to replace our blu-ray player. My wife was pretty much against it, but by the end of the week, she was shopping for games she liked, too! We have 2 kids, 6 & 3 years old. They love the Disney Infinity game set, so does my wife, while I get to play games I want. Only con to the system, don't expect to play earlier Playstation games in the unit. Only plays PS4 games

  Sony's new console feels fast, responsive and pretty. The controller is sleek and comfortable, but the front light can get annoying if it reflects off of your television. The user interface is relatively intuitive, though the inability to pin favorites can frustrate over the long run. The hardware seems amazing, but the lack of software at this time can make it feel like a poor investment at this time.

  I love the PS4, I previously owned all the xbox's and figured I'd try a playstation with this new gen release, and boy was I pleased. This thing is great, it's fast, powerful, plays every game in 1080p thanks to the blu-ray implement. The controller is great too, adding 2 new buttons with the big touch panel in the middle, I like to be able to have different controls for things and the way game devs use the controller is fantastic, the only thing I don't like is that the controller has a speaker and game devs like to put annoying sounds like a cellphone ringing into the controller in their games which is annoying however it can be turned off (I think) in controller settings. overall amazing system, very glad I made the switch.

  It's small, it's powerful, it looks nice. PS4's interface is superb, no need to switch between menus in order to find what you are looking for.New controller feels great, just a big leap compared to DualShock 3. Thing is you won't find true next gen games at the moment so it's better wait a bit, at least till Destiny comes out.

  Great system, no problems other than Playstation Network Issues, which is understandable on launch weekend. Controllers comfort me as a Xbox convert who decided to go for the PS4 this time around.  I went through 4 Xbox 360's since their launch because of their poor quality and still have the PS3 from their initial launch.  *knock on wood* haven't had issues yet and look forward to more games being released.. I also wanted to note that the interface is really nice and navigating through the menus is quick and easy.  The share features aren't something that is of particular interest to me, but I see it's value for others and it doesn't interfere with my gaming at all.  As much as I'm tempted to sell the system now for a quick buck, I think I'll be holding on to this great system!

  Just got my PS4 a few days ago.  Purchased another controller and NBA 2K14 and could not be happier with my purchase.  I can understand if someone is dissapointed on the lack of games and luckily I'm a huge basketball fan and am more than happy to stick with that but in the past I've personally preferred the Sony exclusives be it the God of War series, Uncharted series, The Last of us or just anything by Naughty Dog and I know those are coming and would not want to miss out.As far as the console itself, it works perfectly fine.  Does everything I expected to and works much faster than I thought.  I enjoyed my PS3 but the Xbox 360 menu loading was def better and this PS4 loads everything up instantly no more waiting for the store to load and the multitasking is great as well.  My PS4 was not bricked either and it looks incredibly attractive sitting underneath my TV.  Not really much I dislike about it at all and if I had to make one complaint just out of fairness, if you are in the market to buy either Xbox One or the PS4, I did find myself seeing how usefull the tv plug in for the Xbox One would be if I'm playing 2K14 it would be really nice to be able to watch a live game on TV while I play but not really a dealbreaker.  If you are a fan of some of the exclusives I listed then the PS4 is a no-brainer, absolutely great console.  Powerful, fast and aesthetically pleasing, no regrets from this buyer.

  First off, I couldn't find a PS4 anywhere. Checked all the local game stores and everyplace was out of stock. So I had the option to preorder from a store and wait for it to be in stock, or just order from Amazon. I would definitely recommend the later. It seems everyone ordering from amazon receives their PS4 much quicker than waiting for a local store. I ordered it, and received it in about 4 days. I gotta say, i love it! Coming from an Xbox360, its such a big and dramatic change. Graphics, UI, processing, all so much better! Looking back on the 360, I can't believe what a change it is. I would recommend a PS4 over all other systems, including xbox one. You won't be disappointed!

  First off, I think this thing looks way better in person than it did in pictures, very sleek. Compared to the Xbox One, it's very trim. Playstation's new controller is amazing the analog sticks, weight, and handfeel are all superb. The PS4's packaging is very simple, very similar to a laptop, no frills. Setup was easy, admittedly it took me a bit to find the power, eject button and the disc slot. Games install very fast, faster than Xbox one (at least the ones I tried). PS4's current background isn't customizable and is fairly stripped down, compared to Xbox One's fully customizable and very developed, but almost crowded home page. Setting up a PS+ account was easy as was finding my friends. Overall I was very pleased with the look of the console, the feel of the controller and playing online with my friends!

  I am one of the unlucky .4% I suppose, but I refuse to give this fine product a one star rating. I received it in a timely manner, and everything was working really well right out of the box. After about maybe 5 hours of use my system shut itself off and began to display the pulsing blue light issue. I tried all of the tips in the troubleshooting guide, and a few suggestions from youtube, but ultimately I could only ever to get it back to the dash if I entered safe mode first. In the end I called Sony, and I have to say I was blown away by how well they handled things. They are overnighting me a box and shipping me a brand new system.I'm removing one star because I had this issue at all, but the remaining four are for Amazon and Sony's excellent service.

Processor is powerful and graphics look great. Quiet. Cool. Zero issues. Controllers are really nice. Big upgrade. Get the camera. Future games will use it. It has some demo features with the camera that are great. If you dont want an Apple Style TV box that X-box One is trying to be.... and want a gamers system. This is it. Its also very easy to upgrade the hard drive to 1 Terrabyte if you want. Just look on YouTube. Its just a fast, excellent graphics, gamers system.

  I have been using my launch PS4 a fair bit since it came in Friday.  I am very happy with my purchase on the whole, and I would like to document some of the features that I really appreciate.Firstly, the redesigned DualShock 4 controller is vastly superior to the previous controllers.  I really like how it feels in my hand and how responsive the triggers are.  I also really like the weight; it's a bit heavier than the sixaxis but lighter than a dualshock 3.  Overall, it hits all the important parts.I also want to mention that the console comes with a one-month trial of PS Plus and a 10 dollar PlayStation store code to help lower the cost of your first digital purchase.  Previous news outlets said the system would come with a 2 week pass, so the month was not expected and is appreciated.The last thing I really want to highlight is how nice it is to use the system as a bluray player.  I've used my PS3 for years to play movies, so I thought I'd try one in the PS4 to see how it changes.  Now, you have most common options tied to the option button instead of trying to navigate the little menu after pressing triangle.  It's kind of minor, but it really makes the system worth more to me. Also important is the fact that the disc drive is whisper quiet.Of course the graphics are impressive, but nothing really stands out that I feel is 'next-gen' yet.  But when you consider launch PS3 titles to ones I just finished playing last week, it is clear that there will be a pretty big jump in graphics as people learn to use the machine.I'm really happy I got it, and I plan to play it a lot in the coming weeks.

  Sony's epic failure on Christmas - and still 1 week later in one case - is the reason for the 2 star review. They were not honest about PSN being in ""scheduled maintenance"" when it was widely reported that they were hacked. Four days later and I STILL can not use my download code for the ""pick one of four"" promotion. After following instructions, they say that the code will below can be used, but the code is listed as ""UNDEFINED"". Then, someone on their support page listed this as solved so that you can't add to the list of people saying they are having a problem.To make matters even more laughable, once PSN came up ( still can't use code 4 days later ) , I wanted to start my free trial of PSN Plus. They had the NERVE to require my credit card information to start a trial. What a joke.If you can wait, I highly recommend that you do.

  It's surprisingly small compared to the original Ps3.  It's quiet, comes with hdmi cable, and the new dual shock controller is really nice.The interface is nice, easy to read, very clean looking.I haven't had any problems with it so far.I previously had an Xbox 360 and Ps3 and liked the 360 more, but I made a choice to go with the Ps4 instead of Xbox One because it's more powerful and at the same time $100 cheaper.  I know the Xbox One comes with Kinect, but I think that should be an option because not everybody wants to play or need the camera.  I don't care for the multimedia capabilities I just want to play games and watch BR movies.I'm not giving 5 stars because so far it's lacking in the software department.  Most of the games that are available now is also available on other systems.  It's killer exclusive isn't such a killer (killzone - which hasn't had the greatest reviews).

  This thing is totally awesome to the max and I'm glad I waited a few months to get it so that the teething problems could be ironed out, and they appear to be I haven't had any problems as of yet she runs smooth, cool and quiet and no problems with hand shaking, now the wait is on for the games because they only have like 5 games worth playing for me and 3 that are great the others are either kid games or sports games which I'm not into they don't suck I'm just not into them. Second son which comes out on the 21st should be good I hope. Anyway back to the console one other thing I like is that you can stream movies you own from Sony not download it to hard drive like in ps3 so that's great and saves hard drive space.

(this is a legit thing look it up its confirmed they are using plastic with toxic substances in it).

  Received my ps4 on launch day. My initial thoughts is that its very fast compared to ps3. I have had it for a week now and had no issues with a blinking blue light problem other people state. I guess I lucked out, but did check the HDMI port on ps4 and on cable that came with it to make sure there was no damage or the piece of metal sticking up in the hdmi port of ps4 that people claim cause this isssue.Pro's:1) games look great and the fact you can hop out of your game into the OS and then back into the game with out restarting the game is awesome.2) Live game streaming is a real cool feature for your friends or the general public. I found my self watching other people play games for a half hour. Some of those people are hilarious with there comments when I watched them play. It is also great to view a game you don't own yet to get a look at if you should buy it.3) PS+ is a great deal. I have already downloaded 5 games for free between my ps4 and vita.4) Vita remote play with ps4 is nice. It streams really good in my home wifi and even took the vita to work and streamed my games, and it worked pretty good. Granted I have 5mbs upload at home which probably helped.5) The playstation app is a great add on. I  primarily use it for the virtual keyboard when I am in the playstation store so I am not taking forever to search for something. Games also have there own companion app like for assassin's creed that has its own map for iPad that I had synced to my ps4. So every time I moved in the game it showed on the map on my iPad.Con's:1) I hope in future firmware updates they can have folders options because right now its one long line of apps and games id like to categorize it in future.2) the infamous wobble is there. I fixed it by putting a folded up piece of paper under the front left of the system which solved the problem.3) The fact you need to have facebook to upload videos really urks me. I dont really like facebook and rather not setup a account just to upload game videos. Hope in future update I can save these videos directly to my harddrive or even have a youtube upload option.Well I hope everyone else enjoys there ps4 and even xbox one people, I hope you enjoy your system to. Planning on getting that next year.

  I got a package deal that came with The Last of Us Remastered download, a year of Playstation Plus, and $10 gift card to the PS Store. I love this console. The home menu redesign is major improvement. Pausing the game and jumping to the home screen is easy and convenient. All I have to do is press the PS button. Playstation is leveling the field with Xbox. The touchpad for the controller is a neat feature. I like that I can use it to type; however, I prefer to use the motion feature when typing. I can use the controller like a Wii remote. It speeds up type time significantly. The graphics are amazing of course. Everything looks clean and crisp. The Last of Us really shines in this department. it's worth getting for the graphics alone. While I'm not thrilled I have to start paying to play online, it's not a surprise Playstation went this route. Xbox has done it for years. A year subscription is $10 cheaper than an Xbox sub so that's a plus. Overall, I'm happy with my PS4.

  This is one amazing piece of hardware. And at launch it is a beast. I love the design, the controller is absolutely fantastic, and I can not stress how good it feels. The fan is dead silent and the UI is smooth and runs at a faster pace than the ps3. I am still waiting for Killzone to arrive from Amazon, but no worries, there was a lot to keep me busy. It comes with Blacklight Retribution which is excellent for a free FPS, and I'm still waiting for Warframe to dload. However the most fun I have had is with the broadcasting feature!! It is addictive to watch and interact with players live streaming their gameplay. You can loose hours just watching and conversing with fellow gamers, it is amazing. The PS4 is truly a homerun right out of the gate, something that the ps3 failed to do. This is a must buy console for any gamer regardless of fan boy allegiance. GAME ON my brothers and Sisters...GAME ON!!. See you online.

  Sipment arrived today, I was lucky enough to get in on launch day, but picked free shipping and had to wait until today..big mistake, but my bad.  Got a little worried about all the DOA reviews..I wonder if these are made up.The box from amazon wasn't enveloped in bubble wrap that's true.  In fact the box was almost partially open and the tape had been ripped part way.  When I opened the Amazon box, I noticed a corner of the PS4 box was crushed.  I thought for sure I would open the box to find the PS4 in pieces.No such trouble.  Followed the instructions, it powered right up and has run COD Ghosts and Battlefield 4 with no issues so far.The graphics are really good.  I think the sound is even richer in the games somehow as well. Really impressive and can't wait to see what games that are solely designed for this new platform.

  This console is awesome, Its about better than the ps3 in every way.

Hopefully this helps any gamers out there trying to pick the right console.

  I ordered my system on a Friday and recieved on the following Tuesday well before the time estimated. I was very satisfied with the shipping of my system. I have had no issues with my system since the date of arrival and would highly recommend Amazon to everyone. Also I was unable to purchase the system in stores due to it being sold out in this area. Amazon was the only way to purchase and I am completely satisfied.

  I think this is better than my XboxOne counsel because it's easier to use. The only problem I have with the PS4 is that they shut down or freeze during gameplay at least once a day. I own three PS4's and they all do the same thing.

I highly recommend this for anyone wanting a new game system and has the cash for it. Now if you'll excuse me I must defeat the Helgan threat on Killzone Shadow Fall...

  I love this gaming system! The graphics are beautiful, game play is smooth and the new chat feature is fantastic. The voice chat feature is fun and easy to use. I love that an earpiece is included in the box.What I don't like is the absence of the interface that would allow me to stream music and video from the connected computers on my network. (Our media is spread across 4 computers here). If PlayStation wants to be my go-to media device, it will need to step up.The PlayStation camera and voice commands are cool, but limited. I want to tell the PlayStation to turn on from standby mode. It would also be cool if the camera used the facial recognition to sign in the correct user profile when starting.The free 30 PS Plus subscription code did not work on my existing PS Plus account. It did, however work to create a new one.And lastly, the device does not load the downloaded games onto all of the profiles. This causes an immense waste of time. One purchase- everyone should be able to use it.We have been enjoying this gaming system very much and look forward to many years of use.

  Giving it 4 stars since its still lacking features that are not available on it. Features that for me should've been available on day 1.- 3D playback of movies and games: I dont have hundreds of movies in 3D, but I do have several and I would like to play them back as I used to be able to with my PS3- USB Storage Support.... I still don't know why you would put USB 3.0 on a console if its not for data storage.. its not like the controls are going to take advantage of this and charge faster.- Themes... really ? That default theme and music sucks... yes. I can shut it off (the music) but I would really like to be able to maybe have a something else to choose from.These are things that we'll probably have to wait for, but I would've loved not having to have to do so.By the way... we need a poker game ! ... which reminds me, we should be able to play PS3 games that were purchased on PSN. I didnt finish Uncharted 3 prior to selling my PS3.

  I ordered my PS4 from Amazon on 12/23 and received it on 12/27/13; safe and sound.  The unit runs like a thing of beauty and I have had no problems since receiving it.  By way of comparison to the PS3, this system is a beast - it runs considerably faster, the controller is much more comfortable and the graphics are an incredible upgrade.  I have been playing Assassins Creed 4 on this unit and the detail in the open-world environment is nothing short of breathtaking.  Although I feel that the PS4 is a considerable upgrade in every aspect over the PS3 alone, if you also have the Playstation Vita, the remote play capabilities are second to none.  You can remotely play your PS4 through the Vita without any notable lag time and only minimal decreased quality in graphics.  I am extremely happy with my purchase and the quality of the Sony products, as well as Amazon's ability to ensure its speedy and safe arrival.

I'm currently only playing call of duty ghosts on it, but i cannot wait for future titles that can take more advantage of the technology.

  The new Sony Playstation 4 is such a beautiful machine, the new XMB looks great.Pros:- Great price at just about $400- PS4 is just as small as the PS3 slim (if not smaller) but with a sleeker design.- Graphics are much better then its predecessor.- No ""HUGE"" brick for power supply- Controller feels natural in my hands- Still plays blu-rays, still comes standard with a rechargable wireless bluetooth controller, and still able to connect just about any bluetooth headset available on the marketCons:- Sold out in minutes- Playstation plus is required ONLY for playing online ""multiplayer""- I don't like the new joysticks (indention's throws my aim off)- Not much games (to be expected at launch)

  The system's Operating System is so much faster and more responsive than the PS3 was. Everything is snappy and easy to navigate and switching between a game, the OS, and back again is instantaneous.. The hardware is powerful and even launch games have impressive visuals. The Dualshock 4 is a HUGE improvement over the Dualshock 3, with its larger size, better analog sticks and triggers, and more comfortable grips making it already my favorite controller ever. The system is compact and really well designed - it's even smaller than my PS3 slim that it sits next to! Overall, a fantastic system that improves on the PS3 in every aspect.Pros:+++Hardware Design and Specs+++Dualshock 4 (Everything about it except battery)++Operating System design and responsiveness (including in-game)++Party chat FINALLY comes to Playstation++The 3.5mm headset jack allows you to play with earbuds when you don't want to use a full headset or TV speakers++The improved PSN user pages add a personal touch to your friends list; it even uses real names if you request it from your friend.+Standby mode allowing controllers to charge and items to download+The launch lineup is much better than some people give it credit! Both this and the Xbox One are launching with a COD, AC, Battlefield, and sports games (NBA 2K14 is excellent). Killzone: Shadow Fall is very fun and beautiful as well.Cons:--No way to change PSN ID still--Trophies still require syncing (although it is much faster on PS4 than PS3)-Dualshock 4 battery life is much less than the (excellent) Dualshock 3 battery life-Should ship with a  higher quality 1TB hard drive. Even some people that are putting a 1TB 5400 RPM drive in (should be a lateral move speed wise with the stock 5400RPM drive) are noticing respectable load time decreases over the stock drive.

  So far, SO impressed. I've been a Playstation guy since the original came out. Never have opted to move to XBox because Playstation is just awesome. And once again, they came up with a VERY impressive system. This doesn't look as ""sexy"" as the original PS 3 in Piano Black Finish...this is alternatively sort of plain looking with a cool multi color light going up the middle. But regardless of that, this is a powerhouse of a machine. It does so much and is VERY fast.With these types of systems that connect to the internet, they need to move fast or you'd be sitting there forever. This is very fast. The graphics and game play are fantastic and I couldn't recommend this more.My PS 3 lasted for 7 years, so I hope this one will too!

  I bought this on Amazon.  I also purchased XB1 via Microsoft, I would have purchased PS4 via Sony, but they sent me here when it was announced.  All in all, despite all the hiccups, which occur with any launch of virtually everything, this machine is great, and I think Sony sees potential and builds that in so we may not see all the fanfare when we see the white PS sign in the load up, I'm sure things will constantly evolve.  I own all the systems, I'm a gamer.  PC as well, everything.  I enjoy it.  It is not my life, but when I want to play what Sony has or Xbox or Wii have or even the 3DS, I do my research and follow my gamer instincts; how zen.Games I purchased at Amazon with the buy 2 get one free: Knack (a bit ps3 in graphics), but Kill Zone for the PS4 is brilliant and looks next gen.  Marvel Lego - it's on all the machines, so I'm sure each will have their flaws, but for the first party games, Kill Zone is the better of the lot.BTW: my PS4 works, just as my XB1 works.  I feel bad some of either, did not arrive working.  And I can only hope that all gets fixed.  We must remind ourselves we are gamers and we KNOW these things happens, it's not fun when it happens to us, but it will get fixed.  Change your stars then.  I'm giving both my XB1 and PS4, each 5 stars because I'm a gamer, I want to play and I want what is new and fresh and feels next gen.Controller is much better than PS3, I will admit.  I like both new console's new looks.  We have to think, what if they didn't update them, just the console...but they need to be updated, that's the point - next gen.  I wish both consoles had backward compatibility, but who am I kidding, I'll play some PS3 and 360 games a little longer, but I'm moving forward, I do not touch my PS1 or PS2 or original Xbox or Saturn or Dreamcast or Wii...not since I have Wii U, XB1 and PS4 now...why should I?  I want to remember fondly how fun Nightmare Creatures was, how fun the very first Tomb Raider was, not look back and say OMG...""ain't nobody got time for that"".  So let's move forward... you can't wear the shirt you wore in 4th grade anymore...time to graduate to what is next.  Maybe I'll go back for nostalgia one day :)Remind yourself we are a small community of gamers; let's respect each other and hope for what is to come because the visionaries that create these consoles do it for us... it's a wonderful time in gaming history.  Let's just play and have fun and those negatives that want to come out of our mouths - maybe we should take a moment and play the games, isn't that the point?  Game on! PS Wii U Super Mario 3D World game...brilliant fun!

Real downer because I just bought a $270 turtle beach wireless headset and I have to plug it into the controller for voice chat.  So now my headset is not completely wireless.  I hope Playstation isnt doing this to be greedy by locking out all other headsets to promote their on headsets.  There better be an update to address this issue.

  I have never been one to game and so this review will not mention the ""specs"" of this unit because honestly, I have no idea what I'm talking about in that department... But, my boy friend seriously loves this console. We have the PS 3 and the PS 4 now and he uses both to play games, watch Netflix, etc. This little guy looks nice on our stand, all our friends come over to play the new games for it, and the graphics are amazing. That is one thing I definitely notice, the crisp graphics and how smooth everything is on the TV screen. Netflix streams perfectly as well. Totally worth it the money if you love to game and you prefer Sony over Microsoft (which we both do).

  I received this on launch day and haven't had any issues with it so far.  I wanted to wait a bit to make sure the system was stable before posting a review.Here's what I love:  The interface is wonderful.  It's simple, straightforward and easy to navigate once you dive in.  If you're in a game, you can pop out to the menu and back in without much hassle.  I also enjoy the party chat features.  The other night I played a round of Killzone online with a friend and we chatted away while playing and when we were both doing our own thing.  I like how speedy game installs go off the discs and how quickly you can get into a game.  The playgo feature when you download a game is pretty sweet as well - just a couple hours after initializing my download of Knack I was able to play the initial chapters.Here's what I like:  The share button has a lot of potential.  I've taken a few snapshots and uploaded them to Facebook and the quality was pretty great.  I haven't done much with the video functionality yet so I can't report on that.  I like the social functions, but it could definitely use some filters so you can weed out information you may not be looking to see.  It will be a lot more robust when more of my friends have moved onto the PlayStation 4 as it obviously doesn't track PS3 activity.Here's what I'm not sure about:  Standby mode seems to be working fine, but I have yet for it to download game patches while in standby.  It did download firmware 1.51 and it was ready for me to install when I turned the system on (like the PS3), so that was quite nice.  I'm looking forward to when you can go into standby and suspend a game.To be honest, I have thoroughly enjoyed my experience with the PS4.  It's a solid system, and I highly anticipate what's to come over the course of its lifecycle.  Don't let the stories of broken machines keep you from getting on something great.  I couldn't recommend this higher!

  Ive had my ps4 for about 2 weeks now and it is amazing. So fast and smooth, like every next gen console its slow to pick up. But the ps4 came in running with momentum so within the next year or so the ps4 should be running smooth and when that happens all ill be ready. So I do recommend buying the ps4 just because the future for it will be awesome and you don't wanna get left out from history!

  I'll keep it short. The PS4 is an amazing piece of hardware. The graphics are stunning and so detailed. Granted I haven't played all the games yet but they ones I have are amazing. Tomb Raider being a favorite of mine. The system is also easy to set up and looks cool with this slanted design.

  No video game system launch ever goes off without a hitch. But despite the initial hiccups of the PS4 launch, i am a satisfied customer. Although I have to say that 1) I did not encounter the so called ""blue light of death"" that some had to deal with and 2) I only intended to play one game, so I'm not disappointed with the dearth of next gen games (next year or so could be another story). As for certain multimedia capabilities,  I'm not as worried. It has Netflix, Amazon and Hulu...so most people (like me) are covered for now. I'm sure they will expand on services and all that in the not too distant future. For now gaming is where the PS4 is at, and they have me there already.

  Sony just does things right. You have to consider they have been making hardware for nearly 70 years and they also have been making PC's for upwards of 15 or more. You get to realize why they've been in business so long. The console is sleek, the dashboard is beautiful, maybe not Microsoft beautiful but very easy to use and very intuitive. When I go back and play my PS3, it's night and day and you realize the console is ""next gen"". Boot up times are faster, graphics are crisp, hard drive is hefty and most of the launch games run 1080p and either 60 or 30fps. Considering this console is to last us another decade or so, I don't want my games to be ""upscaled"" to 1080p from 720p. Not to say it's future proof but it does boast some impressive internals. I had no issues aside from having to plug it in to a somewhat empty power strip. It is after all in a way a small computer in terms of power usage. Great controller, solid as a rock and a bit bigger than the older ones. You can game for a couple hours and not have your hands cramp up. Solid launch line up and with them dropping games to download for free if you're a PS Plus member almost every week is just an added bonus. For $50 dollars a month extra it's still under the price point of the competitor and you get loads of discounts, on top of which they threw in a free 3 months for first time buyers. For the price and the features, in my mind it's unbeatable. Happy Holidays!!!!!

  Great piece of tech and the games selection - while small at the moment - is great. A few quirks on some of the functionality:- using the Playstation app on my tablet requires that the PS4 is set to use a wireless network instead of using bluetooth.- remote play or 2nd screen functionality with a Vita does not allow streaming video functionality- minor settings that would be nice to adjust:  - being able to disable the light on the dualshock controller  - being able to disable the BEEP when the console turns on (or not beep when turning on using a controller)- also waiting for a 1st party media remote. I hear the 3rd party remotes are OK, but seems strange they didn't work on one for when this releasedMinor nitpicks, and mostly just different ways of doing things from my Xbox 360.

  Many people are reported to having problems with their PS4. My friend was one of them. However, the Sony Store managed to replace his console immediately. I, on the other hand, had 0 problems out of the box. The PS4 is slick, quick, and incredibly powerful. The interface can get a bit messy at times, but overall its a huge improvement over the PS3's interface.If you're on the fence on getting the PS4 due to reported defects, keep in mind the actual percentage of people having problems is around .03%.Regardless, the launch lineup is nothing to be impressed about, but here's to the future.PROS:Game run smoothly and look amazing. Battlefield 4 runs at 1080p with 60 FPS.UI is slick and way better than the PS3's (needs QoL fixes though)Incredibly powerful system. You can switch between apps pretty fast, and trophies load way faster than on the PS3.New trophy system is amazing.Really easy to swap out HDDs.The controller is the best yet.Playstation+ offerings are great. Resogun is tons of fun, and Contrast is a unique experience.Party Chat is great and allows you to easily voice chat with your friends.You can use your phone/tablet as a second screen.CONS:Buggy/sluggish at times, but very rarely and only on certain menus.Apps like Amazon Instant Video freeze the console occasionally.UI could still use some work. Need to be able to organize trophies/games/etc better.Launch line-up is underwhelming and doesn't show off the console's powerful potential.

  I purchased the PS4 on day one as I am an avid gamer. The system gets a 4 star because in my opinion it builds upon everything that made the PS3 great. I am withholding giving it a 5 star due to the lack of games at the moment (early adopter I know), and some of the media features that were present on PS3 are not available now.The XMB is MUCH faster than before, and much faster than XB1. I give it the edge over XB1 because the system is focused on just being a games system and does it well. In my experience It has not froze or experieced some of the quirks of apps not doing what you expect (looking at you XB1). I currently have Killzone (great), AC4 (decent), Madden (decent, not a big jump over previous gen), and Resogun (great).So all in all very solid start from Sony and I know that it will continue to improve.

  I was disappointed in the lack of original titles at launch, however my experience overall went well. The controllers seem to wear down much sooner than I'd imagine (joystick material peels after 1 month use). I wish the software was better. There was nothing more frustrating than to open my SOE unlimited music app and try to play my playlist and then see the app crash after a couple songs played. But hopefully my app woes will be fixed soon with a patch update.

  I don't post many reviews but I wanted to go ahead on this one and offset all the complaints I'm seeing out there. I got my system, took about ten minutes to set it up and it has worked basically flawlessly. I have frozen two times on the first 2 days both times due to high volume PSN problems. Never had the update bog down because I went ahead and downloaded the update to a memory stick and booted in safe mode to install my update. Took 3 minutes.I see people worried because 750 people have reviewed because theirs was faulty. But stop and think, how many people are just like me and never review the things they get that work perfectly. How many review the things that are broken? A brand new system has a few issues- shocker !!! System is a great improvement on PS3 and as more games come available will prove it's worth. Also, PS Plus is great and several of the free games are amazing.

  Truly one of the best VIDEO GAME consoles from Sony. In case you didn't catch it I capitalized ""Video Game Console"" because unlike their competition Sony built a great gaming machine. Sony really dug dip when designing this console and it is very easy to see that they finally reached out to what people had disliked about the ps3.One of the biggest changes you will notice is the controller. I personally never had a problem with the dualshock 3 being to small like other. For those that disliked the dualshock 3 will be happy to hear that the new dualshock 4 is a gamechanger. It's larger, more weighty, improved triggers(fps games), and the analog sticks have a hybrid design using both convex and concave.Now for the console. What can I say. It's been nothing short of amazing. The UI takes the ps3 xmb and gives it a drastic overhaul. The specs that Sony chose have all been top notch except for the 500gb hdd. The positive to this is that Sony allows you to upgrade your hard drive without voiding the warranty. In the end its faster, more powerful, and cheaper that their competion(XBOX One).For those having difficulty choosing a next gen system heres my short break-down.PS4-faster, cheaper,more powerful and a dedicated Gaming machine with decent entertainment supportXBOXONE- slower, more expensive, 50% less powerful than ps4,#GreatnessAwaits

  The title says it all.  I've had no issues or crashes and there are barely any load times. The games are fun and look gorgeous. The one downside is the lack of games but that is to be expected at launch.  If you are wanting to make the move from PS3/Xbox 360 to PS4 but still have lots of good games to play through already for your previous gen, hold off until Summer when the titles double, there's no rush and it's not worth the stress of finding one.

  As a gamer I've been all over the place as far as what system I've owned, in what generation.My mom bought me the PS1 (I was like 7-8 and the PS2 was already out lol) so I was a bit late to the party. Then I had a PS2 a few years later; & that was without a doubt Sony's golden age, where anyone who cared to play video games pretty much had one, or had a friend / family member who did.Last Gen. I made an interesting choice considering which 2 consoles I'd owned previously, I EXCLUSIVELY played on the Xbox 360 *ducks* and never owned a PS3 for even a second! I don't believe in brand loyalty, or fanboy-ism so my choice in siding with Sony this time around comes from realizing this was the best option for GAMING vs. owning an Xbox One.I won't go into why I feel the PS4 is the superior console, but rest assured you won't be disappointed for the next 6+ years until their 5th console arrives on store shelves! .. or Amazon ^-^

  What can I say about the next generation console? It's pretty amazing. From the fast processing, to the set up on the main screen and it is so easy to navigate. The controller is much easier too instead of having the start and select buttons you have the pad to tap and it brings up everything that the start and select button would have in the past. I would suggest getting a charging station along with the console and it's a shame that the camera didn't come with the system. I am excited to play other games on this system such as Infamous Second Son, Watch Dogs, Shadow of Mordor, Destiny, and many more.

  System is great, graphics are great, only issues are a lack of titles, backward compatibility and the Playstation Network.Titles are coming, so that's cool. Backward compatibility was already disclosed, so that's just a wish, but PSN being necessary for online play is something different.If PSN were still free, I could deal with the outages and downtime, but now that I'm paying for it? No. This needs Sony full attention.

  This console is my 1st experience with a PS system as I have been an Xbox person for the last 10 years. Have to say I am blown away by the capabilities of this console and cant wait for the truly next gen games to arrive.BTW, Ignore the Xbox fanboz and their one star ratings. Xbox lost me when they clearly were targeting a ""living room experience"" over gaming. Plus they sell info to the NSA. So they lost my trust and Sony gained a fan. While I will miss Halo, I wont miss wondering what personal info Xbox is collecting and using.

  I pre-ordered my PS4 the day it was announced. For a while, I wondered if I should have pre-ordered it from a local store but I'm glad I didn't. I received it around 9 am on release day and have been enjoying it since.Though I heard/read some people had issues with their PS4s, I haven't had a single one even though my PS4 gets used daily.My PS4 is extremely quiet. I have a Super Slim PS3 (also purchased through Amazon) and even though it's quiet, the PS4 makes it sound like a noisy beast (it's not).Even though I had no complaints regarding the Dual Shock 3, the Dual Shock 4 is a big improvement. Initially it felt weird using the R2 as the trigger in shooting games but it didn't take me very long to get used to it.It's funny how many anti-PlayStation people made such a big deal about the light on the front of the controller. Even though I always play in a completely dark room, it doesn't affect or bother me at all. In fact, I like it because it allows me to find things (cellphone, TV remote) without having having to turn on the lights.

  With the free overnight Shipping and 2 games included, I couldn't pass up the opportunity to finally get a next generation console. Having it for about a week now I am completely impressed.Console came with A digital download of the Last Of Us. I had played through this on my PS3, It was one of my favorite games that I've played and will definitely play through it again.It also came with a code to download one of four games. I chose Far Cry 4 and have to say it's amazing. The graphics are out of this world.The new controller is very cool. It took a little while to get used to the touch pad, but it became second nature after a couple of days.It does have a 500 GB hard drive, but with the size of games anymore, I am thinking of upgrading that to a 2TB drive. It's definitely a plus that Sony will allow you to add a different hard drive.I usually wait a year or so after a new console comes out so that any issues can be worked out, and also because it seems like a while before games really start coming out for a new system.All in all I am really happy with the new system. I cannot wait for several games that are going to come out in 2015. Namely, Dying Light, The Order: 1886 and Uncharted 4, a Thief's end. It will definitely be a happy year of gaming.

  Last Gen i owned all the three consoles. PS3, XBOX360 and Wii. I played Wii the least followed by PS3 and then XBOX 360. I was confused as to which system i should start this gen with. Though XBONE had lot of gimmicky features, i decided to settle with PS4 because of the superior graphics on 3rd party titles. The system is functioning perfectly well as a gaming console (i didnt buy it for using apps and streaming stuffs, i have other gadgets to do that). I am playing Shadow of mordor and Infamous second son. And the games are visually much much much better than the last gen. I would suggest that if you are really interested in gaming, then buy this console. If you need it for other purposes like streaming, skype etc. then buy XBONE.

  Was able to order PS4 on 12/3 when there was a short window of stock. Although I must admit I've been a lifetime Sony/PS fan (as far as consoles go), I'm very impressed with the PS4. The UI is clean and simple, setup was a breeze, and graphics/gameplay are a big step up from the previous generation. I've also noticed that Sony's online store in the console is much more responsive than it was for the PS3 which is nice because I felt like purchasing games on the previous console was a pain. Additionally the new controller offers everything to like about the old (PS3) controller with a few significant improvements namely: better grips, improved triggers and joysticks, etc. Lastly the console's sharing features are tightly integrated and are easy to use.Overall, would recommend the PS4 to a friend.

  I'm not one to usually post reviews but thought I would make an exception...I received my PS4 on launch day, no issues.  The packing was sufficient but I would have liked a little bit more padding on the bottom to protect if it took a big drop.I had previously received my extra controllers and PS4 camera so I was ready to go.  Setup was quick and easy but I was a bit confused about power on as I didn't realize the power button was in the little vertical slot on the front of the unit.  There is no physical power toggle on the back of the unit like with the PS3 to hard power off the unit, instead when shutting down you have standby or power off options.Face recognition for login works great and is very helpful if you have kids playing! I can just hand them controllers it picks up their faces and they are off and running using their own profiles.I haven't had any issues with PSN login or any games and so far am really enjoying the experience.  I also have to say the new PS camera is a huge improvement over the PS3 version.The controllers feel good in my hands and my kids have been able to operate them easily also.There are some differences I am still adapting to... The lack of start/select buttons instead having an options and share button is taking some getting used to.  It was nice to see that my PSN account carried over all my information as should be expected...

  the only question you have to ask when deciding weather or not to buy this is, ""are you a gamer?""  I'll probably get grilled by some xbox fanboy about this review, but the facts are the facts.  This is the superior piece of hardware, and with an easier system to develop for without all of the restrictions of the Xbox one.  The simple thing is it is a better piece of hardware than it's competition, that crossed with all of the restrictions and forced extras.  I'll openly admit I am somewhat biased, I have always had sony consoles, however that said I am also the kind of person that goes for the best system regardless of manufacturer, and I have had the last two generations of Xbox as well.  Just save yourself the frustration and get the Playstation.

  Even better than I thought!  I can't wait for the PS Store to have more items though, but it's all in the making right now.  Also, be advised, the low-star ratings come from malfunctioning units.  With over a million units being sold in preorder and on launch day, there were bound to be issues.  4,000 units were reported as malfunctioning.  4,000 out of a 1 million?  That means out of a 1,000,000 consoles manufactured, 0.4% malfunctioned.  Overall, the system is pretty amazing.  PC gamers feel like it's outdated, but not everyone wants to press keys when you can have more control with the controller.  I feel it's a great investment, whether you're playing or buying for children.

  So far so good. What a piece of tech. Very intuitive. Runs VERY smoothly. The graphics on this thing are INSANE. Had a little trouble setting up the network but it was all user error on my part. I would recommend downloading the update onto a usb flash drive before you start playing as it will erase all of your data. I was only an hour or so into Battlefield. So no big loss. My favorite thing about it so far is the ability to route all audio through the controller into any set of headphones you want to use(don't have to buy a 25$ adapter like the X1). Keep up the good work Sony.

  Didn't have any issues at all with my system aside from my mail man not getting here until 6pm.I have played through Killzone and Battlefield 4 and both look amazing. Had lots of issue with BF4 but that's a software issue with the game, not the system and Dice seems to have finally cleared all that up. The system itself is super quite and nearly invisible on my entertainment rack. The UI is quick, clean, and snappy and I love sharing screenshots and video clips to my Facebook feed.Definitely looking forward to some better games coming out but that will happen in due time.

  I give it 5 stars because from day 1 of purchase to today it has been a flawlessly workign system. I know some people have had issues with their systems (i.e. disc drives, blue light of death, etc.) but that is to be expected on a new launch. Mine, fotunately had none of those issues and despite lacking a large library of games to choose from (another expectation at a new launch), it has provided me with some great hours of game play.I recommend this system to hard core gamers and people that don't care so much for the ""1 box meets the needs of everyone in the family's living room"" type of system. This system is mine and is not shared with the family. If I were wanting a system that streams movies, navigates my cable box, video chats with family from the comfort of the couch, plays music at a party and also plays a variety of games I would probably have chosen an Xbox One. I wanted a system focused on games and games alone for a good price and I think I got exactly what I wanted. Sony's focus at E3 was obviously pointed toward games and I think they are sticking with that mantra. This isn't for everyone but it's what I think you should think about if you're trying to decide between the two top systems. Xbox One is a great system from what I've seen but I don't have a cable box near my gaming system. If my gaming system was in my living room, where my family congregates, I would have thought highly about getting the XB1. I do like the instant snapping between TV and Gaming, skype easily on the tv is nice too. All that stuff I might buy into sometime later when the console is cheaper. For now, I want my games and I want them my way.My only gripe at this point is the lack of games. It's also a little louder than the XB1 but it's certainly nothing to get upset about as it's not as loud as the previous gen. Also, the matte finished side is great but the shiny side is susceptible to getting lots of fingerprints (I wipe it down and dust the inside out weekly as it sits next to my tv in plain view and I like it looking good). All in all, it's worth the money.

  Not a whole lot to say other than I've been playing Assassin's Creed 4 and absolutely loving it. Graphics are noticeably better, the environment and lighting show so much more detail than ever before. I can't wait to see how far developers push this new platform.

  The day it arrived, it had severe performance issues. It lags on every game, takes insanely long to load, has trouble loading the actual game world, and half the time, will not read discs. It basically came with a busted hard drive and disc reader.

  Sony delivered again!!  This is much more than a Video Game Console.  You can turn it on and log into Nextflix,Redbox, PlayStation Music and much more on this multimedia console.  With a 500GB hard drive you have more than enough room to save progress in your games or get a digital copy of a game if you decide to go that route.  The graphics are phenomenal and very realistic.  The Blu-Ray player is just another addition that makes this great as you can watch Blu-Rays on your PS4 and if you have a 1080P TV and a good stereo system, it looks and feels like you are in a movie theatre.  I would recommend this over the XBox One from what I've read and heard from friends that decided to go with Michrosoft, almost all of them had buyers remorse.  This is much more than a game console as I said as there are lots of apps you can run on the PS4.  Also if you become a part of the online community, there are games you can play that are geared towards online play and it's amazing how realistic they made the online gaming.  You can win trophies for individual games and also trophies when playing online, which makes it fun and incentive to reach goals.  I don't have anything bad to say about this system, and the controller is easy to use, even if you haven't used a PlayStation controller before and on some games, the controller shakes when you get hit or there is something around you that would make you shake in the game.  The controller also has a light sensor on the top of it, which lights up in some games, such as Grand Theft Auto, when the cops are on your trail.  It's a neat addition feature in my mind.  I hope this review has been helpful and those who buy the PlayStation 4 on Amazon will love it as much as I do!!

  As a lifelong Playstation user, I am impressed with the gaming capabilities of the PS4.  I'm a casual user and can definitely tell the difference in terms of graphics and flow of the two games I've played (FIFA 14' & Assassins Creed IV).  Future games will probably unlock the real value of the PS4, but for now it has everything a gaming console should.

  Great graphics. I just need a PS4 controller for Blu-ray/DVD player to give it a 5 stars. The DS4 controller is not the best for this job; and I don't have any other TV/DVD player controller to use it with.

  I love this console and the moment I picked it up, I began to drool.  It looks pretty damn nice and the fact that it's smaller the PS3 Slim is impressive considering this is the first generation PS4 console for the most part and not the Slim variant.  Kudos to Sony for this.  So let's go over the pros and cons because as much as I love this console, there are bound to be some problems over the long run.  Keep in mind that my pros and cons are based on my observations and everyone's thoughts will vary.PROS:- Sleek and modern look- Replaceable HDD (you can even swap it with an SSD for some better performance).- Easy ability to broadcast on certain services (Twitch, UStream, etc.)- Dualshock 4 controller is definitely a step up from the Dualshock 3.  Feels a lot more solid and has so much more functions.  You can listen to in-game audio through the 3.5mm headphone jack located on the controller.  A step up from the PS3.- Certain games allow you to use the Dualshock 3 controller if you want to use it.  The Dualshock 4 is also able to be used on the PS3.CONS:- No backwards compatibility with PS3 games.- The LED light on the Dualshock 4 controller can be a little bit annoying if you have a glossy screen television.- The glossy plastic part that covers the HDD can attract a lot of dust.Overall, these are my viewpoints of this after using the PS4 for some time.  I can't wait to play more games on this console.  Especially the new exclusives that are coming out later in the year.

  Purchased this and imported it to the UK.  Used my UK PS3 power cable to power it with no problem (The PS4 has a universal internal power adapter).  Thorough inspection of HDMI port showed no defect, the day one firmware update applied without any issue.Excellent service from Amazon, shipped from the US on Thursday and delivered on Monday via DHL.Reason for importing was to allow Region A playback - so the Criterion & Shout Factory discs shall be mine!

  I'm going to make this as brief as possible.First off, the hardware is fantastic. This thing has GDDR5 and specs that even PCs can't compete with at $399.The controller is great but not as ergonomic as I'd hoped.I've had issues with freezing and poor playback of Blu-rays since I got it.The thing that really hurts it in the early part of its lifespan is the library. I was bored of my PS4 within the first seven days of owning it, and I don't know of anything short-term that will cure that.In other words, wait until mid 2015 before buying one of these.

  It's the best console released ever from long time ago, I bought two consoles, and I was unlucky in the first one cuz I faced that damn blue light issue, but in the second one worked normally, the console is very quite and it's start up interface is very friendly and you can move easily from the game (in side the action) to the main menu to do some stuff easily then return to the action smoothly with no issue, there are a lot of adds on apps can be used and almost of them with great value and really they selected them carefully,The DS4 is great but it's battery is going down quickly than before (3x times)  which is reasonable because of the new functionalists,The GPU is really nice, but still there are no released game used the GPU 100% except FIFA and NBA2K, the graphics were great there,The standby mode is very nice and useful, it's orange color is so nice and giving the living room a so cool mode,In short word, don't think to ask yourself to get PS4 or XBox-One, it seems like you comparing between Ferrari 2014 and Fiat 1986 :)

  I have read a bunch of horror stories about a blinking blue light and thankfully never had that problem, knock on wood. I received mine on Friday 11-15 as promised and opened it up. The packaging definitely lacked by Sony but Amazon had it in a larger box with packing bubbles so there was no shipping damage. Plugged it in, established my internet connection, set up my PlayStation Plus account, and proceeded to load my games.The games load smoothly enough, I opted to let them load and install before attempting to play. I like how you can enter the dashboard without exiting your game. It paused it and when you click on the icon to reenter, it is instantaneous right where you left off. I did find that I had to be closed out of the game program in order to browse the PlayStation Network Store, so if you don't think the Store is working, close your game.The graphics on games such as Battlefield 4, Killzone, and Assassins Creed are pretty incredible and Knack is quite fun. Every game ran very smoothly and I never even noticed it saving. The controller is more comfortable than I imagined it would be. It is smooth yet grips your hands and the joysticks contours are great. I like the changes with L2 and R2 a lot. They are way more comfortable and pressure sensitive and the entire controller is super responsive.I like my PS4 very much. The only criticism I have is that the User Interface is a little lackluster. But it is straight forward. I like how when you select a game and push down, without entering the game, it gives you info and game stats and multiplayer map info and game control info etc...Overall I am completely satisfied with my purchase. I hope all the issues get resolved for everyone and they don't loose faith in it. It is great.

  I've had zero problems with the console itself. It's the controllers that are bad news. After 2 weeks of playing, my right trigger got sticky and stopped working for like 2 days. It's really loose now and feels like it will break off.The rubber padding on the joysticks wear out too quickly. I don't even play everyday and my padding still is halfway off. Other than those things, the console is great.

  Hardware:+ Slick, compact & quiet.+ No power brick.+ The new controller is awesome! For me last-gen was all about the 360 controller. Wasn't that fond of the DS3, but the DS4 is one of the most comfortable controllers I've used. Great for shooters too.- Power and eject buttons are tiny, had to scratch my head to figure it out.UI:+ Much better than the PS3 & 360. It might look similar to PS3's XMB, but it's far more functional.+ Jumping between games and OS is blazingly fast.+ Switching apps is seamless.- My only real complaint is no customization.Features:+ PS4 is a social box. This is where Sony has been very forward thinking.+ Twitch integration is awesome! You can literally start broadcasting at any point. I've had friends watching my feed on cell phones and other devices. Never thought i'd use it but it's quiet awesome.+ All your friends have an activity feed, you can see what they're up to & watch their streams.+ PSN finally has an Xbox Live style party system, unified voice-chat! It all works seamlessly.+ Managing multiple accounts is quite simple.+ Background downloading is just awesome.What to expect at launch:+ The 1.50 Firmware update can be downloaded while you play games.+ The launch lineup is decent.+ Free games, of which Resogun is the killer app.- DLNA ( media server ) features are not included at launch, but are coming in an update ( confirmed by Sony ).- There are some PSN outages due to the high volume of traffic right now. But it hasn't affected my ability to play and stream stuff.

  1 star only for the Amazon Warehouse option and description of the USED PS4. I purchased a PS4 from the Amazon Warehouse - arrived with out a controller in the box; Contacted CS - They suggested to order a 2nd PS4 and return the 1st one.  After a few days, the 2nd Amazon warehouse PS4 arrived.... without a controller. One was shipped from USPS and the other was a UPS.Otherwise, the PS4 is awesome.. I can watch the loading screen and look at the blue wave going by - makes for an excellent $200 screen saver.UPDATE: Amazon was able to refund my credit card the $44 for a new controller - so Thank you CS;Now rating it a 4/5 - love the console, but just be aware that Amazon Warehouse does not ship controllers.

  This was one of the most important things I have ever ordered from Amazon and the worst packaged. They slapped a mailing label on the original package and mailed a Playstation 4 with no protection to my office. When I received it, the box was dented, and opened. the seal had been sliced with a box cutter and I'm not sure I got all of the boxes contents. What an absolute joke Amazon. I have received Lego toys in boxes 50 times their size to protect a $10 item, and you send a sold out $400.00 Playstation 4 with zero protection though the mail in it's original box with zero protection? What a debacle. I'm disgusted.

  Ordered my PS4 on the day of launch, got to my home a day later.  Great system, very fast menu's, launching games, and moving from various content.  I logged into my Plus account and the system brought over my trophies from PS3 etc. very nice integration.  Played Killzone and have to say that this is by far the best controller I have ever used, its comfortable, balanced well, responsive, and the new touchpad is integrated rather well.  Other cool features with the controller are that the LED changes color based on input from the game, starts to turn red when you are hurt, green when you are outside, etc. and there is a speaker in the controller which when I picked up an audio file within the game, it played through my controller like I had picked it up myself.  The visuals of the games are amazing, the lighting is by far the most realistic I have ever seen, where you can see dust sparkle when light through a window hits it etc.I have seen some negative ratings coming from those that received defective systems and that's unfortunate, with a large scale undertaking of putting our over a million units, the law of nature is that there are going to be a small percentage that will not work or have issues.  I am sure Sony/Amazon etc. will work with those that have problems, but don't let that taint your perception of the system and/or Sony at least they are not jamming TV watching and football down your throat like Xbox is.  This is a Coke/Pepsi, Mac/Pc type of thing, if you were an xbox owner before you will probably get an xbox, and PS owners will get the PS4 and that's fine, but if you want to focus on games, I am happy with the PS4 and the slight edge that is has over the Xbox one (with RAM type/speed mostly) and the developers that Sony kept in the loop as they developed the system.  Sony has learned from their mistakes, as for Microsoft they tend to do what they want and its not always in the right direction, just look at Windows 8 (or every other version of windows over the years that was a steaming pile of dung).  Sony had a plan, put a good system together and MS came out with a bunch of rules on their system and has since been trying to backtrack and fix their poor system plan (used games, always online, to name a few).In the grand scheme of things, a year down the road, we will have both systems running side by side and those on either side of the fence, I chose my side day 1 and am happy with the decision.I still have my original PS3 launch system, works perfect, and that was a complicated system to manufacture, this PS4 is like a new PC, so I am looking to a long life cycle with the PS4 as well.enjoy....

After a few failed attempts I finally got signed in with the correct e-mail.  Be prepared for update download for operating system but after set up played only game I had for it and found it to be very good.  The controller is high tech and glad it retains the style and feel of the original.  Hope more games come soon and prices drop.  Enjoy.

  The Playstation 4 is an awesome machine. I have had it since launch and it is still running perfectly I have it on constantly to watch Netflix and play games, it has never overheated or acted up in any way. The one gripe I do have with the system is the controller and it's thumb sticks. Within 2 months I had a tear in the left stick but Amazon was quick to credit my account so I could get a new controller which is just pure awesome on amazons part. The launch library of games is a bit lacking but that is usually the case for any new console. The fact that you don't need a playstation plus subscription to watch netflix and other video service is a plus, PS+ is only needed for retail multiplayer games, free to play games do not require you to have the subscription.

I first tried it through the system notifications, and it only downloaded the update, but wouldn't install it (kept saying ""Preparing for installation...""). I then tried it through the ""System Update"" option and everything was fine. The download itself was a lot faster than downloading updates on the PS3.If there's one word I can use to describe the PS4, it's ""Smooth"".  Everything, from the setup, the interface, the integration with my PSN and Facebook account, and the games are super smooth. Cold boot times for me (to the point of selecting a user) is sub 20 seconds.  From standby mode it's about 12 seconds. And don't underestimate the improvements to the controller - I really had no idea they could make such a positive change. It really has to be used to be believed.I've been through a couple 12+ hours playing sessions, and my PS4 has performed flawlessly. It barely gets warm, and it is extremely quiet (I can't hear it at all and it sits about 6-8 feet from me). I've also played online, and although my internet connection is pretty poor, I had great response times and no trouble with connection drops so it appears the PSN network is improved over my experiences with the PS3.There's a lot to like here and won't go into everything. All in all I'm extremely pleased. I'll update this review after about a month especially if any problems develop.

  My system was luckily shipped with a few other items I ordered so it was protected quite well. It booted up properly and the update took less than 3 minutes in total. The PSN network was a little bogged down so it too me some time to login. However, I was able to play my game immediately while waiting for a PSN connection. The system itself is very quiet and though does get warm I was able to play it for 12 hours without an issue. When turned on it takes a minute to boot up. The UI is very simple an beautifully designed. I am not bombarded by adds and can find my game of choice quickly. The graphics are amazing and I have yet to see a frame rate issue. It is very powerful. I was a xbox exclusive person and am glad i made the switch.

  Pleasantly surprised.Purchased PS3 for $270 on 10/2013.  My plan was to capitalize on the now cheaper PS3 games, and not immediately buy a PS4.Along came Diablo III and I decided to bite the bullet and pick-up a PS4.- Build quality of both the PS4 console and remote feels better than PS3- User interface flows more smoothly- Colors and resolution is MUCH more crispThe reasons alone made spending the additional $130 worth while (PS4 for $399 on 8/2014).Definitely buy this console!

  Awesome! I used to play 360 exclusively but owned a ps3 and let it collect dust.  This is much better than the ps3! I am back to being a playstation fan! The only gripe is the interface isn't as user friendly as the 360. It needs for more games though! !! Nba12 and battlefield are the only two great ones out right now. ....

  I want to say this was one of the best shopping experiencing I have had, and especially at a very busy Christmas shopping time.  I was a HERO with my son and it is all because of shopping on Amazon.  The product came in perfect condition and I can tell you the PS4 has reached every goal my son had anticipated..  The Delivery was faster then expected without a problem.  All I can say to Amazon is Thank you Thank you ....

  I love ps4,its fast, has futuristic tech design, user interface looks fluid and well made,ps store with big posters is very  well fit, share button is very innovative,has great apps, browsing web and playing game at the same time is nice and love  the games i purchased look next gen and cant wait for upcoming games to play!!! But i'm not sure, that will be achieved, if one your Controller buttons breaks, unfortunately that has happened to my one controller, R2 trigger broke and its somehow not functioning when pressing, its bent down on right side, i feel the worst is about to happen to my second controller, R2 button somehow is getting a gap bigger and i think it will break soon as well. I've had PS4 with controllers for 2 months already and this happened, which is not good at all.  I don't how to fix it, i wont buy another controller, that would be ridiculous and serously have no money to spend for third one. The only way  i thought  would be to buy controller repair parts like R2 L2 triggers, but i can't seem to find it anywhere over internet. As to the warranties, i don't have it and don't think they'll give it, as  i've had ps4 more than 30 days off purchase, warranty  costs  from 50 to 60 dollars, quite like controller price. the build for controller is not good for R2 triggers, as both my controllers R2 actually broke, this is where sony made a huge mistake making it so cheap, hopefully they'll fix it in upcoming DualShock controllers, but now can't seem to see ways to fix it.

  Arrived prompt and in impeccable condition. Great job AmazonI have always felt comfortable shopping on amazon, and will continue to do so.I also have an Xbox One and after spending some time on both systems I have really enjoyed they layout on the PS4.It is simple and clean, improved from the PS3 (in my opinion)Both systems are great and have their strengths and weaknesses.I really like that I can stream movies through Netflix or Amazon on the PS4 without having to pay additional fees (must have Xbox live to stream movies through apps like Netflix on Xbox One).I also like That the PS4 controller comes with a built in rechargeable lithium-ion battery (Xbox you have to buy a separate rechargeable pack).These are just some small differences, but add up in the end.Graphically speaking games look fantastic on both consoles.Right now the largest problem with the PS4 is lack of Games.While both systems are new and lack a large library of games to choose from,In my opinion the Xbox One has more interesting selection of games, and my kids love the Kinect on the Xbox One.

  I pre-ordered the PS4 system the hour they were available to pre-order and I picked Amazon because I could get launch day delivery. I waited all day, finally it came, I hooked it up and it ran great. I bought three games for it an started playing all of them.The second day started some issues with connecting to my HDTV. It would say ""no connection"". Then a week or less later it would freeze up, make a horrible noise and shutdown or restart just after a few minutes of gameplay. It also did this out of the games, just if I was sitting at the main PS4 menu. Now it's completely locked up and I can't turn it on and there is no video or audio at all. Luckily I was able to get in and delete my user settings and profile before it completely bricked up on me. Amazon said they have replacements, so I'll be sending my bricked up unit back and be getting a replacement.So, my PS4 symptoms are:Power issuesVideo connection issuesFreezing, jolting and just shutting downFinny noises coming from the unitBesides that, the system is amazing. I played Killzone, Assassin's Creed and CoD Ghosts. All looked and ran amazing! Short loading times and I love the controller. The touchpad is a really nice feature.Everyone with a system should we cautious of these issues as I didn't start having major issues until a week later. Also, Sony says the power issues effected like 1-4% of the one-million systems sold. So others should not be discouraged from purchase the system based off a few issues. I'm a PlayStation user all the way and I must say this system is amazing and they did everything right.Highly recommended!*UPDATE*I received my new PS4 system from Amazon the next business day. I hooked everything up and it's working great! The first thing I noticed was that it is quieter than my defective system, which makes me think it was an issue with the power supply, possibly over-heating. Just like the PS3, the PS4 saved my trophies, however I lost all my game install information, saves, and updates. over-all I am very happy with Amazon's speed to get me a replacement, they paid for shipping back of my old unit, and I'm just happy my new system works.***UPDATE*** 26 May 2014My PS4 just started a new issue this past weekend. During gameplay, or whenever a disc is in the system, the PS4 will beep and just kick it out. I looked it up and many others have also had this issue. I will be contacting Sony for a replacement or repair. It has been perfect since my first replacement, now it looks like I will be going to my 3rd PS4. The PS4 is still and will always be an amazing system, despite the little issues I have had. Remember, the flame which burns twice as bright only burns half as long. I will keep this review updated once I have more information.****UPDATE**** The ejecting of the disc on my PS4 is due to the little rubber foot directly below the eject button. This rubber foot pushes up on the button ejecting anything you have in there. To fix it, I simply pulled a piece of the rubber foot back and folded it under the PS4. If I had this standing vertically, I may not have had this issue as the rubber wouldn't be compressed. Regardless, the issue is fixed and that is how to correct it if you have similar issues.

  The ps4 is everything I hoped it would be and more... With great games like battlefield 4, cod ghosts, and free PlayStation plus games and many more to come like infamous and watch dogs and a new uncharted game. Plus all the social features, TV and video apps, and the overall speed and graphics of the ps4 makes it most definitely the best console yet!

  In a word, it is awesome.  The graphics are crisp, really like the new controller after getting used to it.

All steps forward, nothing backwards.

It'll be fine.

  When I 1st opened & hooked it up that blue light that every1 talks about happened. I heard the blue light is caused by mishandling so I guess that's what started it. Then It wouldn't show up on my screen plus restarted it self about 4-5 times. As I unplugged & reconnected the cords & tv, it worked. I've had been enjoying my system ever since. All I can do is hope it continues 2 bring joy.. Fire

  I almost never leave a review.  I have to be honest the only reason I am leaving this review is because I had heard of how man unfortunate people have had issues with the PS4 they had delivered from Amazon.I got mine Friday afternoon. It was packed appropriately, by that I mean it had enough airbags top and bottom.  The box was not dented.I love the system, I hear some people complain about the UI but I think it's great.  I'm not going to spend any time discussing it really, there are plenty of gaming sites that have done a better job then I can.  I just had to post a review because generally only people that are unhappy seem to review and I wanted to remind people of that fact.

  Purchased from amazon when I could not find any local. Works perfect. Streams better than its predecessor. Multitasking is excellent and the ability to kill apps including games when they freeze is awesome. No more forced reboots during errors. Extremely quite. Do not even notice it when the system is on. Auto updates. Only reason I gave it a 4 star was the lack of 3D support. Unless this is updated via a system update I will have to keep this a 4 star. Love it however for online gaming and streaming. Would recommend to anyone.

  I love the PS4. I think it is a worthwhile upgrade over the PS3 which was already a great system to begin with. The system is fast fluid and responsive. The 8GB of GDDR5 ram really make the system snappy and speedy when opening apps and or games. My only gripe is the size of games that install. With the 6x BD-Rom in the system it should be much faster than the 2x in the PS3 which means developers should be able to stream data off the disc specially with how fast that main system ram is.

  Even though the software is still on its infant stages the console itself keeps showing why it is ahead of the pack with every update. It has worked very consistent over the 600+ hours I have used it with only 1 hard freeze which was caused by the game Warframe. The remote does die faster than the one its predecessor had possibly because of the light that comes in it which remains always on. All in all it is a great system with a promising future if the developer take advantage of the hardware and its many features.

  Works fine for me...Opened it, installed it, completed the setup in minutes and was downloading Contrast, Resogun, Battlefield 4 and Killzone right away.  It took like 3 hours to get Battlefield and Killzone downloaded, so I played Resogun for awhile...cool little indie game.  The controller is great, the system is running smoothly, no problems with the HDMI port or anything like that at all.My only beef is how bad Killzone was...game is awful...don't even bother, if you really want it, wait a few months and get it for $20...just an awful, awful gaming experience....

  A couple things are still lacking with the PS4.Game selection:Getting better later this year, sure.  However the lack of titles from the PS3 that are available in the online store is kind of annoying.  I really would like to catch up on Uncharted or relive my Kingdom Hearts days.  So far this is not possible.Playstation plus:All you really get is a few deals and 3 free games a month that are really just PS Vita games.  I wish I hadn't paid for it yet.Form Factor:Why are there no standard USB ports on the back of the system?Why is the option button so hard to press?All that said, I think the system shows a lot of promise.  It's fast as hell, pumps out some really clean, awesome graphics, and the controller feels almost weightless in your hands (at the cost of battery life, to be sure). I can't wait until they really put some work into the playstation store and get it up to speed with this generation.

  My son loves this. Not only are the graphics and game great, it integrates well with his Sony Vita Handheld. He's able to play the game from his Vita remotely. Only complaint I would have is that Sony doesn't have their Bluetooth configurations completed yet. Most Bluetooth headsets and ear pieces don't work because they aren't profiled by Sony yet. I understand they have their production priorities, but somebody should have been working on this.Nevertheless, the machine itself looks svelte and works flawlessly.

  I love my PS4. The graphics are comparable to my high end computer minus the anti aliasing and tessellation. I got the PS4 mainly to play the console exclusive titles since everything else I will get for my PC. I have only played Killzone: Shadow Fall so far and I love it. One feature I really like is the ability to watch other people live streaming their games. It was cool to watch other people play Battlefield 4 since I was contemplating getting it for the PS4 since my friend also has it. All in all I am very happy.

I bought this from Amazon for the retail price of $399, not those high prices on those reseller sites . For all those bashing the PS4 , its your own opinion , but as for me , I just love my new PS4 , hope all those wanting this gets one , and Happy Gaming !

  I have enjoyed video games since 1977, when my parents bought me an Atari 2600. I have been hooked ever since. I play it all from PC games, to Gameboy. I think that fanboy flame wars are just silly. I am a huge fan of the Playstation 1, and Playstation 2. With the Playstation 3 I felt that Sony got a little bit away from what made them the industry leader. Not that I did not like Sony's first party offerings, they were some of my favorite games of this generation. I felt that Microsoft had made more of a game machine, while Sony made more of a complex multimedia machine. Not this time, Sony came out firing on all cylinders, this is a game machine. It has amazing streaming capabilities, has a slick interface that is simple to use, and it has one of the most comfortable controllers I have played with.  Yes there is a lack of titles as of this writing, Killzone, Tomb Raider, Skylanders, Outlast, and Resogun to name a few are really worth playing. You can see it though, the potential, the graphic capabilities, this machine is the total package, and at 399.99 you can't beat it. Infamous will be here soon, along with MLB The Show. It's more powerful, and one hundred dollars less then the competition. It is worth it, right now. Buy it you won't be sorry.

  I normally don't write reviews on amazon but I felt compelled to do so because of all the negative comments that the console has been receiving on various websites and the reviews here on amazon.  Let me start off by saying that I currently own 2 PS3(one launch 60gb and one slim 120gb), 1 Xbox 360 fat Arcade edition with a 250gb hard drive(jasper motherboard), a Red Mario 25th Anniversary Wii and a 3DS XL(so no I'm not a fanboy). I will start off by saying that amazon was quick on shipping it and making it worthwhile to have pre ordered it from them(better than standing out in the cold and potentially get mugged or shot for it).  Second the packaging was well put together in order to avoid damages to the console itself.  Now let's talk about ease of setup.  I can tell you that i did not have a single hiccup throughout the entire process.  Basically after plugging everything in and turning it on the console pretty much told me how to setup everything else without giving me any sort of error.  It just worked like it should.  And as for those who said that they could not access psn to download the update to firmware version 1.50 I cant' comment because my console was able to connect and download without any issues(in case you're wondering I set it up to connect through wifi which was also a very simple task).  So as far as experience in setting the ps4 I have no complaints as it was very straightforward with no complications whatsoever.Now here are the pros and cons of the console itself:Pros:1:  Quick to boot up.2:  Graphics look much more detailed.3:  You can play the game without waiting for it to install.4:  1080p at 60fps5:  Controller design is actually better especially for first person shooters.6:  Includes headset(which I personally don't care for since I don't like to chat with people while playing).7:  Can be setup standing if needed.8:  Cheaper than an Xbox One by $100 and $200 compared to my launch PS3.9:  No mandatory gimmicky camera.10:  User replaceable hard drive.11:  Easy navigating UI(User Interface).12:  No need to pay additional to stream Hulu, Netflix and Amazon Video.13:  PS Plus subscription will carryover from your PS3 and you still get a code for 1 month free in the box along with $10 credit for PSN(which is a good deal considering all the free games you can play for as long as you are a member and not to mention all the additional discounts you get when there are sales on PSN).14:  Can still play Blu Ray.15:  All games are now installed on the hard drive making the time to load quicker and at the same time no longer need to be worried about the laser on the Blu Ray drive getting overworked(  considering the fact that it is easier and cheaper to replace a hard drive than a Blu Ray drive).16:  You can access online social media(if you care about that since most people do but me personally don't have any of those accounts nor do I care to sign up for it).17:  Record your gaming sessions to display online(again if you care for that sort of thing which I have no interest in but a lot of people seem to do so).18:  Cheaper than a gaming PC and without the hassles of incompatible drivers and settings.19:  Game prices are still the same compared to current gen.20:  Sony first party games and exclusives that will never be available on PC or Xbox.21:  Internal power supply.Cons:1:  Not a lot of games available yet(but that's typical of new console launches).2:  Seems to run hotter than my PS3 slim (but about the same as my Fat 60gb launch PS3).3:  Needs more space for venting.4:  No backwards compatibility with PS3, PS2 nor PS1 ( although Gaikai is supposed to take care of that but I'm sure it will cost something).5:  Can't play your own music( at least not now who knows if a future update will allow it).6:  No more free online multiplayer gaming since you are now required to get PS Plus.7:  No longer can it be played on old school tube televisions with RCA inputs since it only has HDMI and optical for sound( but not an issue for me since I only have HD lcd televisions at home).8:  Small Hard Drive( considering the fact that some games can take up to 50gb but you can always make room by deleting old games or replacing the hard drive with a 1TB unit).9:  Still not as good as a gaming pc.10:  Games could be had for less on PC.Regardless of the Pros and Cons just remember one thing and that is the fact that anyone who is looking for a next gen console should be considering themselves as beta testers because not everything will work perfectly regardless of which brand of console you purchase.  No to mention launch games are always for the most part decent but not ""OMG this is the reason to upgrade"".  For me the number one reason to purchase a PS4 was so that I could play Call of Duty Ghosts and Battlefield 4 in 1080p at 60 frames per second since I don't own a gaming PC (which by the way is the only games I have purchased so far). So if graphics and gameplay is important to you and you have the disposable income I say do it. Now if money is tight just stick to the current gen since there will still be a lot of new games being released on the current platform so you'll still be ok.

  Sony has delivered another masterful console this time. PS4 is the most sexy console I have seen. The console is small, sleek and beautiful. I actually liked DS3 and after getting hands on DS4, it is hard to go back. If you want to know all the features and tech specs, you should check out the CNET reviews. I will admit, I was little worried if my console would be bricked and so far it is running smoothly (fingers crossed). The only drawback is the launch line up. There are only few games but luckily all of those are awesome (KZ SF, Knack and AC4). You need PS Plus for Multi Player but you will always get free games with it so that a good deal.The menus are stream lined, PS Store is super fast. I love it.

  The PS4 is a great console. It has good graphics and sound. I love that you can listen to spotify while playing games. Also the shareplay is a nice feature, it allows you to give an online friend control of your second controller so they can play with you even if they do not have a copy of the game. Combine this with PS Plus and you get free games every month. The only thing that I have to complain about is the controller. It wears out easily, the touch screen is basically useless since 95% of games don't use it (it gets used more as just a regular button than it does a touch sensor), and the battery life on it is terrible. If you turn the light on the controller off in the settings or even just dim it it helps save the battery a lot.

  It's a really awesome system.  I've had the ps3 since it first came out.  The graphics on the ps4 for battlefield are so much better than the ps3.  It's very realistic and awesome.  There aren't a ton of games yet for the ps4 but Infamous just came out and the graphics are said to be amazing.  Also a version of the batman games is coming out and its only for new consoles.  Need for speed is really cool and battlefield is the greatest.  Also Cod ghosts looks really good on the ps4, but I don't think much difference from the ps3.  Also the vita is fully compatible with the ps4 so that's going to be a lot of fun too.  And they are selling a ton of cameras for the system.  Oh the other great thing is the share feature, its a button on the controller you press and you are two clicks away from broadcasting yourself playing your favorite game to whoever you want.  you also capture a screen shot the moment you touch the button and it records your last 15 minutes of gameplay for upload.All in all, the ps4 is an awesome system and some sick games are in store for the future.

  The console itself is beautiful. The design is simple, but elegant. It's size is perfect; maybe 50% bigger than the Wii or Wii U. It's nowhere close to the VCR sized Xbox One.The Dualshock 4 controller is a huge improvement from the PS3 controller; the handles feel longer, fuller, and more ergonomic. The light on the back of the controllers is an interesting addition, though it does seem to diminish battery life a bit. The touch-pad is another cool new feature, though it's a little awkward at first and takes some getting used to.The UI is pretty clean easy to use. It seems to be similar to the PS3 UI, but with influence from the Windows 8 style Xbox UI. UI response is instantaneous, and game load times seem quite quick. I liked how Killzone: Shadow Fall went straight to the main menu when I started the game (of coarse, that kind of game load will depend on the developers of each game) .At $399, the price was far more reasonable than the PS3 launch price.I never had a PS3 or Xbox 360 of my own, but I played on both consoles quite a lot. My last console buy was the Wii. If I had one of the primary last gen consoles (read Xbox 360 and PS3) already, maybe I wouldn't have shelled-out 400 bucks so quickly. But for someone with nothing better than a Wii, I'd say the PS4 is definitely worth the money.

  The Playstation 4 is going to be a force to be reckoned with this generation, unfortunately the selection at launch is a bit paltry. Overall the system is fast, the controller is responsive, the menus are easy to navigate (once you've learned the layout, it's not complicated) and a Playstation+ account is a strong suggestion for getting the most out of this console. Also, think about upgrading your hard drive. 500 GB is decent for now but in a year or so that might be straining under the multitude of 35-50 GB games in store for us.Overall, strong system with great potential. It seems as if we are in for many surprises from Sony and Playstation.

Amazon gave me a credit for something that wasn't their fault. It did come the 26th and my boyfriend absolutely loves it. It is all around an awesome console. There are so many things you can so with the ps4 it ridiculous. The graphics on this thing are insane. Everything he's played on it haven't had any complaints. If you are looking to get a gaming system I highly recommend this one because of the versatility. Extremely happy with the purchase.

  This is a huge leap from the ps3.  1080p at 60fps is excellent!  Realism is the best I've seen on console and we haven't even seen what this thing will do yet.

  The PlayStation 4 is an excellent purchase and a very well designed machine.  The first thing that will strike you is just how sleek the system is.  No matter where you place it, or whether you chose to sit it up or sit it down, it adds a bit of modern elegance to your entertainment setup.As far as the User Interface is concerned, it is another outstanding showing and a vast improvement over the PS3.  The UI is FAST, responsive and very easy on the eyes.  If you have a large-screen HDTV, you will really appreciate the new look of the XMB and how smooth the transitions are.The feature set is really too long to go into so I will list a few of my favorites:The ability to switch from game, to store, to Live Stream, to Internet Browser to Settings without having to quit your game.  The speed at which the system switches is incredible.Sharing Video, Live Streams, and pictures seriously couldn't be easier.  They are easily uploaded to Facebook or Twitter - and it all happens in the background - meaning you can upload videos or activate streaming without leaving your game.The graphics of the games are incredible and a decent leap from the PS3.  Even when playing games like Resogun; you keep withing for a frame drop or slowdown but it never happens.  This is one powerful calculating machine.Did I mention Resogun...PS4 comes with a 30 Day membership to PS+ which offers free games and is needed for some multiplayer games that aren't free to play.  Among those free games is a title called Resogun.  Stop what your doing right now and go play this game.... I'm not kidding.  Its like watching the greatest fireworks finale ever.So yeah this review is pretty basic.  The games are great, the hardware is powerful, the UI is slick and the design is elegant.

  of course 90% of people who got bad systems will leave a bad review. but only 10% of people with good systems will leave a good review.sony says.4% were bad, not 4%, but .4% (though its likely that number is low). so 4,000 out of 1 million units. it happens, and believe anything under 3% is considered normal for electronics.The good:1) Size - incredibly small2) appearance - it looks like it belongs in any and all entertainment centers3) quite - lot less noisy then my day 1 PS34) great graphics! (though not a huge jump from the best of PS3 games) systems dont really bring out the best in games for a few years. the best ps2 game was close to the first ps3 game. but the latest ps3 games looks drastically better then the first ps3 game.the bad:1) less then a handful of games worth playingthe ugly:1) user interface seems empty (im guessing this will be changing with updatesUPDATE:At first the only game I played was COD Ghosts. I am now a halfway through Killzone and i want to let everyone know i think the graphics are much better then Ghosts. I figured that makes sense, Ghosts, was created to work on 4 systems, which means it probably isnt really optimized for any of them.where as Killzone was made and optimized for the PS4. Ghosts was Meh, BUT Killzone actually makes me excited for future next gen only titles. enough so, that i think i am going to sell my Xbox one. though i have only played Battle Field 4 on it, which is just like Ghosts, in the sense that it was made for all systems.

  The PS4 fixes all the annoying things about the PS3, with fast load times, a slick UI, and most importantly it pretty much eliminates the constant installing and updating (it's done in the background now while you play).  It's a great game machine with plenty of great games already, with some really amazing graphics.One thing overlooked by a lot of people is that the PS4 has several of free-to-play games with more on the way.  DC Universe Online and Warframe are out now, with other games like Planetside 2 (and probably Everquest) on the way.  If you're a PS Plus member you also get the free games with that (Resogun is a must-buy even if you're not a member).  There's a ton of games in the pipeline and you don't even have to pay for many of them.If you have a PS Vita, the awesomeness gets turned up to 11, as Remote Play works really well.  Set it up and enjoy your PS4 games anywhere you have an internet connection.  There can be a bit of lag so it's not ideal for games like COD or Killzone if your internet connection is bad, but your PS4 game collection becomes a part of your Vita game collection too.

  Playstation may have lost the battle with the 360 but with release of the PS4 it putting the Xbox 1 to the grave early.  There is a reason the PS4 is out selling the Xbox 1 on a 2 to 1 ratio and that is because it is a quality machine.  It is still early and we can expect many more features that will separate it from the pack.  The only downfall with the PS4 is it's hard drive 500gb may seem like a lot but with games getting bigger and bigger your hard drive will quickly fill up but wait Sony has a fix for you.  You can easily remove the hard drive and put in a 1tb hard drive.  I could go on and on about the PS4 but pick it up and find out for yourself.  Happy Gaming

  I think PS4 is a great deal as it's priced very reasonably considering its capabilities and graphics.Pros:1. Graphics- Most native 1080P games among all consoles, if you have a large TV, you will see the difference with upscaled games.2. Games- It's still very early in this console generation, but PS4 has the best versions of multiplayer games like Call of Duty and Metal Gear Solid V (higher resolution and better effects) and all the exclusives like inFamous and Uncharted plus many others. When you look at PS3 and Xbox 360 (I own both), you will see in the last few years PS3 still has great hardcore exclusives like Last of Us but Xbox has very few.3. Features- It doesn't force you to buy a camera, it's optional and will work with Virtual Reality headset Sony just announced.- Even if you don't buy PS Plus, you still can enjoy apps like Netflix, HBO Plus, etc; On Xbox, most apps are not usable without a Xbox Live Gold membership.- Remote Play lets you play most PS4 games with your Vita with even Internet connection outside your home.- Its UI is very smooth.- The controller is the best I've used among all consoles (subjective), has built-in rechargeable battery unlike Xbox's, save you money on $25 recharge kit or batteries.- It continually records the last 15 mins of gameplay, when you press ""Share"", you could choose a portion to share easily. Xbox One on the other hand has a delay in starting to record the gameplay after you ask it to.4. Playstation Plus- As mentioned above, it's not required for games like inFamous, only if you wanna play multiplayer games. It's $10 cheaper than Xbox Live Gold and comes with great free games like Batman: Arkham City (PS3) and the new Outlast (PS4) and Mercenary Kings (PS4). In comparison, Xbox Live Gold normally gives out really old games free.5. Design and Size- It's much smaller than Xbox One (which looks like a big and old VCR) and it doesn't come with a power brick, very important if you have limited space in your AV cabinet.Cons:1. Work-in-progress Blu-ray movie playback- Right now certain Blu-ray movies won't play (don't know why) and it doesn't support 3D Blu-ray yet. Hopefully this will be patched later, 'cos there's no reason why PS3 could do all these but PS4 can't.2. No DLNA support (yet)3. No backward compatibility with PS3 (same with Xbox One)- However, Sony already announced a service called Playstation Now to stream PS3 games, Microsoft hasn't announced anything like that4. Controller battery life- It's not as long lasting as the PS3 one, but now you can recharge it at night when the PS4 is on standby.In conclusion, this is the best console in market right now, you won't regret it!

  I definitely love my PS4. The pay-to-play online with PS Plus was a little disappointing, but at least they give you a decent list of games throughout the year. There's a great list of games for the system and the hardware is pretty powerful.My biggest complaint would be the charge times for the controllers, they only last a few hours each. I feel like I'm always charging them and I'm really contemplating just keeping a plug next to my couch, which shouldn't be something I have to deal with. I've heard there's a new set of controllers coming out for the PRO system that have a lot longer life, so I may get one or two of those.Overall, if you're in the market for a console, you can't go wrong with the PS4 because there's so much to offer.

He was really happy with the game choices and said that he had no issues with the downloads. At time of purchase, it was the best deal I could find while researching for weeks. We use it every day. I would recommend dusting it every once in a while, but we have animals so that might be our contributor. Even if you had the PS3 (we did, too), I would recommend the upgrade, it's completely worth it.

  The PS4 is good.  I wouldn't really call it ""next gen"" right now, though.  The graphics are awesome, but don't expect to get this and be BLOWN AWAY compared to your PS3.  Yes, it's better, but it's not like ""OMG THIS IS BLOWING MY MIND!"" good.  Also, there's not many games available right now, and almost all of the games have bugs.  I'd recommend AC4 and BF4.  Don't even waste your time with COD Ghosts... it's worse that BO2.  I'm interested to see how good the games get as time goes on.

  System works great out of the box!  Playing COD at the moment.  Haven't really tried any other launch titles yet, except for the freebies they offered on PSN (resogun, contrast).  The system is lacking some basic functions that were present in the ps3 such as mp3 and video playback via usb drive, home screen customization and streaming from my PC.  Supposedly those functions will be implemented later, so I'm not docking off any points just yet.  The video sharing feature is pretty cool and the new playstation store is much faster and easier to navigate.  The new dualshock is a big improvement over the previous DS3.  It just feels better in my hand.  Looking forward to new updates to the system.  Hopefully i'll be playing more of the system once watchdog and infamous comes out.

  So far after a week with the PlayStation 4 I'm satisfied.  The hardware runs very well; things are much faster than previous generation in terms of game loading and navigating the system.  The UI is simple and basic; if you're looking for some crazy gorgeous presentation then you're going to have to wait at least until they start rolling out themes because it's pretty much generic in its looks.  If you're upgrading from the PS3 however you'll realize that it's a marked improvement over the XMB as things are a lot easier to find and react much faster.Loving the look of the games and the feel of the controller.  The controller is probably the biggest thing to talk about because it's an ENORMOUS improvement over the DualShock 3.  Feels good and responds very well.  It'll take some time getting used to not having Start and Select but you'll adapt.  Didn't get the camera so the light bar as it stands right now is only useful if you have two because instead of a number assignment it changes color to indicate what number player you are.  My only gripe would be that the battery seems to not last as long; it still lasts a good while but I feel the DS3 has a bit more life.Another big thing is that the network seems to move a lot faster.  PS3 used to basically limit your download speeds but that seems to be gone with the PS4.  Online gaming is great and they seem to really be pushing the social aspect really hard which is kind of unusual because again, if  you're coming from the PS3, you'll remember that people barely interacting in online gaming.  I love the party chat feature and matchmaking seems to be a bit better.  The share features are amazing; the Twitch streaming is great and it's cool to see so many people using it.  It actually makes for an easy way to check out a game and see if you'd like it or not without doing a lot of searching for gameplay.  My negative to this would be that it doesn't seem to queue downloads so even though they're faster if you have several games, demos or updates to download they run concurrently and that in effect will slow down the process.  Even with that though it's STILL faster than the PS3 network.So overall I like this system a lot.  Would I recommend you jump and get it now?  No, but that's because I never suggest that anyone buy a console at launch.  We've all seen the problems people have been having (the real ones at least, as sadly people have been making false claims), especially through Amazon.  While I do like them a lot i do have to call Amazon out on their packaging.  I know a lot of people feel like it's just a made up claim but it's actually true: Amazon did a pretty poor job of packaging the device.  Basically what they did was place the PS4 at the BOTTOM of the box, flush against the box's floor, and then dropped some air bags on top of it and sealed it.  If you know anything about shipping companies (especially UPS) you'll know that the drivers don't adhere to any warning labels; they will throw your box around without a care, so imagine them tossing your PS4 in the truck and how hard that bottom would hit the ground.  While I'm sure it's not the main cause of problems with the PS4 on here it's something that should be taken serious and complained about to Amazon because even with a working PS4 I'm not pleased by that at all.Still overall like I said it's a good console.  If you wait you'll most definitely end up with a better experience than us impatient people out of the box because eventually more of the features will be added, fixed, and developed into what they're suppose to be, but as it stands now it's a fun console and definitely worth the upgrade.

  What can I say, it's simply the best gaming console ever made, and with each system update it becomes even better. I will say that the 500GB HDD is quite small, especially with the amount of space required by many games. I personally upgraded my PS4 with a 2TB HDD (for about $130) which I would suggest to anyone who considers themselves more than just a very casual gamer. Other than the small HDD, this is a great product and should be your number one choice for a Next-Gen/New-Gen/Current-Gen console.

  Mine is working! Sorry to hear so many people are having problems with the PS4. Mine is working fine so far after 5 hrs of gameplay. I will continue to get killed on Call of Duty and see if it could withstand the heat.The graphics is noticeably better than the PS3 and I think the developers are barely pushing the console yet. It takes time to them to get use to the platform to get the most of out it. I can't wait to play of my favorite titles on this console. Let's hope it lasts me 3 years.So far I'm happy with my purchase and I'm finally back to playing games on the console. I miss those days.

  I was kind of nervous after reading some of the early reports of system failures right before the PS4 launch. I found one for sale at midnight and decided to order anyway since I've been wanting one of these for quite awhile. Man, I am so glad that I went through with the purchase. This is the best console I've ever owned. It has worked perfectly from the beginning and it turns out the launch failure rate for this product was around 4%. That is below the industry average for an electronics release of 5%. It truly feels like next gen with the speed of the OS and the look and performance of the games. I did debate for awhile on whether to get this or the new Xbox One. After hearing about the increase in power with the PS4 and that you are forced to buy the Kinect with the Xbox I decided to switch over to PS. I was a huge 360 fan the last generation. I am sure that I made the right decision. Most of the Xbox One games don't really have ""next-gen"" graphics and I don't want to have to give my Kinect voice commands. I think that is really pointless. Last generation I mostly preferred the 360 for the controller. I just didn't really like the PS3 Dualshock because I was just never comfortable with it. I have to tell you the new Dualshock 4 is amazing. Probably the best controller I have ever handled. I have big hands and I don't feel like it is way undersized. Overall I love the PS4 and am very satisfied with my purchase.

  Simply amazing. This is everything we were promised, and more. I've been playing Battlefield 4 and AC IV Black Flag, and I have to say, it was money well spent.The console itself is a marvel, sleek and silent and impressive and simple all at once. The UI was overhauled and can now be accessed at any time, even while playing. Games can be suspended to do something else, and resumed without interruptions.The PSN now actually works, and the current game selection, while small, is great. PS+ actually gives you free access to a couple of them as well, so it's great that I already have a small library available (Resogun comes HIGHLY recommended!)The controller did the impossible and actually beat the 360 pad in terms of comfort. The thumbsticks were altered and are now shorter and thinner, with a concave top and grippy material. They are also a little further apart than the PS3. The triggers are also a vast improvement over the PS3, no longer sloping off the back of the controller, but more angled up, similiar again to the 360. This is GREAT news for shooter fans.Get this. Now. You need it. Get the second mortgage. Send your kids to your mother's house for a month. Take a vacation. Tell your significant other you'll be ignoring them a little.

  The Good:--Console is practically silent when running--Controller is FAR better than the DualShock3 in the hand.  Touchpad works great.--Great console design--The UI is similar to the XMB on the PS3, but significantly improved.  Less crap to wade through than before, unless you WANT to wade through crap.--Game installs are fastThe Bad:--Graphics are good, but not mind-blowing.  It's just beginning though...they'll get better.--Controller battery life is not that great.  My PS3 controller is years old and still holds a charge longer than the PS4 controller.In all, I'm satisfied with the purchase.  No issues thus far with it...fired right up out of the box.  Had it now for a little over a week, though my play time has been light due to a heavy work schedule.  Have 3 games, Killzone (playing thru now), AC Black Flag and Battlefield 4 (both still unopened).  The lighting and particle effects in Killzone are strong, but the character models are still decidely last-gen.  I like how the LED on the back of the controller changes from green to yellow to red when your health goes down and then fades back to green when you heal.  Can't really see it when playing, but it's little details/flourishes like that that give me high hopes for future games.Playstation Plus is very nice...there is a lot of great content there, certainly enough to keep someone busy for a few weeks even if they don't have a game disc yet.  The ""Live From PSN"" feature is a lot of fun, which lets you watch other people streaming their games.  Talk about a GREAT way to research games and find out which ones you'd like (or hate)...good stuff.  I've already discovered that Knack looks pretty undesirable...maybe if I was more interested in button-mashing games.  On the other hand, the Lego/Marvel game looks pretty amusing.To those who received non-operable systems, my condolences, and hopefully Sony will get you up and running ASAP.  I can confirm that my unit was VERY poorly packaged...just a cardboard box slightly bigger than the PS4 box, NO PADDING OR CUSHIONING WHATSOEVER, and while it was taped shut, the outer box was not well-sealed and you could easily see what was inside through the ""crack"".  When I saw how it came, I was pretty sure it would be broken, but I guess I got lucky that it wasn't mishandled (intentionally?) by those hacks at UPS and it is working normally.  Amazon, get your act together when shipping electronics.Anyway...back to Killzone!

  I've been a gamer since the early '80's with extensive knowledge in the industry.  Knowledge or not, it's still just my opinion.There are many reviews and articles detailing the PS4's power in addition to comparative ones; so I won't touch that subject.  What I will chat about, is content and the controller.I purchase platforms depending on content and the PS4 is finally delivering its first exclusive game that interests me.  Infamous Second Son.  In fact, the only reason anyone should ever get a console is to play exclusive games.  Otherwise, PC's are the way to go (there are a couple of rare exceptions where the console choice was superior).If you're going to invest $400 of your hard earned cash, take a step back and think.  What games do I enjoy that aren't available on a PC? What first, second, and sometimes third party developer is most like going to produce a AAA title?At the time of this review, the following games have been confirmed exclusively for PS4:Driveclub, The Order: 1886, Killzone, Infamous, Uncharted, Knack, Deep Down, Earth Defense Force,Everybody's Gone to the Rapture, MLB, Secret Ponchos, Resogun, Rime, N++, Basement Crawl, Joysound Dive 2, Shadow of the Beast, Lily Bergamo, plus others.Sony owns extremely talented studios and several fantastic franchises.  Last generation, they brought us new IP's such as Heavy Rain, Uncharted, Little Big Planet, Infamous, The Last of US, Beyond Two Souls, ModNation, Flow, Flower, and Journey.  In addition, they own some great franchises.  Although we haven't seen some in years, there were several notable ones such as God of War, Twisted Metal, SOCOM, and Killzone.Make a list and compare, Do you want to play Nintendo's Zelda, Metroid, Mario, Donkey Kong, Kirby, Fire Emblem, X, Super Smash Bros, and Mario Kart? Or, Microsoft's Halo, Gears of War, and Killer Instinct? Perhaps it's God of War, Uncharted, Infamous, Little Big Planet, Heavy Rain, Killzone, and ModNation games that mostly peak your interest.Since Sony is a Japanese company, they're likely to get some superb role playing games.  Persona and Ni No Kuni come to mind.Controller: It's fantastic and definitely an improvement over its predecessor.  This time around, it includes a speaker, touch pad, and an interactive light.  Nintendo holds the crown when it comes to the D-pad but Sony is a close second.  The analog sticks are further apart which is an improvement.I don't care if a console has Netflix or Pandora.  The primary purpose is gaming and that's what my rating is based on.

  My console works, I think!  After updating, the first thing I did was update the firmware, which went without a hitch.  Took a couple of tries to log into PSN for the first time; my guess is that PSN is bogged down from launch day.  Tried sharing a game on Twitch, which caused the system to hard freeze; couldn't force shutdown the PS4 using the power button, so had to unplug the system.  While installing Warframe, the system stopped responding a couple of times, again requiring a reboot; think it was related to resolution, as dropping down to 720p allowed the install to complete.  Still a bit unsure about how stable the system is; the system wouldn't wake up from standby, but I was able to force shutdown the system that time.  Hoping these are all just firmware or software bugs.Problems aside, I'm impressed with the console so far.  Haven't seen any signs of overheating so far; in fact it's quite the quiet console, compared to my Xbox 360.  The graphics in NBA 2K14 looks AMAZING.  There are times I feel that I'm watching a live game on TV instead of playing the game.  The Dualshock 4 feels great in my hand; it's not overly thick, and has a nice heft to it (that's the one thing I didn't like about the Dualshock 3).  Being able to stream all audio through headphones connected to the controller is perfect for late night gaming; I like how it uses a standard headphone port too, so I can use any headphones I want.  I love that Sony made the PS4's hard drive easily accessible and user-replaceable with a standard laptop hard drive; I plan to upgrade the 500GB drive to a 1TB fairly soon.I'm happy, but still cautious of the system stability.  Once more games come out and the bugs are worked out, I'll update the rating.

  I first want to say that I am sorry to all those who have defective consoles. I know how frustrating that is and had to deal with it for a previous console launch. I won't name the console but it was a terrible experience. I wish you the best of luck and hope you get working consoles soon so we can play online together. I received my PS4 on 11/15 and was very concerned with the possiblity of a faulty console from what I had been hearing on various gaming websites. I had a minor issue when setting up my network connection. The system would keep asking if I wanted to use a proxy server over and over and then got stuck at ""please wait..."" I had to power off and power on again and reconfigure the network. I also can't switch network profiles. I took the console to a friends house and was unable to remove my previous wi-fi settings. I am confident these issues will be worked out in a future patch.I purchased Killzone, Knack, and Assassins Creed:Black Flag. Of the three, Black Flag is my favorite followed by Killzone. I don't really see a huge improvement in graphics but you can tell there is a difference. Launch titles never really deliver the amazing graphical experience that the console is capable of, at least in my past experience. The controller feels much heavier and is more responsive. The change to the L3 and R3 buttons alone make this better than the dualshock 3. The console is fairly quiet and gets louder when the fans kick on to cool the system. It runs a little warmer than I would prefer. Don't keep it on the carpet or in a closed space.Overall I am happy with my purchase and hope those who have broken systems get them fixed soon.

  Having now had my PS4 for a month I've used quite a few of it's features. I've tested out it's voice commands (which have worked thus far, though admittedly not as advanced as Microsofts, it has the potential), I've played quite a few of the free games (a lot to be had from PS+), and now have about 4 games for the PS4. I'm impressed so far with how quickly the system can go about switching between tasks, and how crisp the games look especially when compared to the same game running on a PS3/XB360.Yes there aren't THAT many games to play at launch, but you buy a system for it's potential, not on what's on there currently, even if what is on it currently is quite fun.I do recommend it to anyone that has the interest (and the money).

  I have two Xbox 360's and went through 4-5 console failures, charging cables breaking, profile sign in problems, controllers with loose battery packs etc. That thing was a money pit. The PS4 has been great. Tons of free games to play right off the bat, rechargeable controllers that work(NO MORE BATTERIES!!!!) charging cable is the same as my phone charger. Games run at 1080p/60fps. Online service has additional games included for PS4 PS3 and Vita. I love everything about this console and it will only get better from here.

  Having owned the console for 9 months and prior to that an XBox 360, I can honestly say this is a great console. The console hasn't ever locked up on me or required some crazy reboot like the 360 would do periodically. It is a beautiful piece of hardware and looks very modern compared to its Microsoft counterparts. Starting the console up and getting into a game is very quick; however, I do miss the XBox style dashboard. Sony could use a better interface and increase the signal to noise ratio with all the extra stuff on the dashboard.

  Day 3 out of the box and no issues. I will say that Amazon packed this in an odd way with only the big bubble wrap on one side and not the other. May have left the unit succeptible to falls which would give most of the force to the PS4 box itself. Luckily my unit is working great. This has been the smoothest launch ever for me. The PS4 speaks for itself in terms of speed and features and this is just launch firmware we're working with here.I installed a Seagate 1TB SSD Hybrid drive and load times have been outstanding across the board.Many games to play including f2p titles like DC Universe Online, Warframe, and Blacklight retribution. You don't even have to spend a dime to get some enjoyment on PS4. There also Contrast and ResoGun which are both really good games.Very pleased with features like remote play which let me take my Vita and use it as a second screen. Works exactly as advertised. You cannot beat taking the Vita and control of your PS4 with it in any room in the house.Can't wait for the following weeks and months for the lineup to increase in size.

  The PS4 has many positives which greatly outweigh the negatives.

  its a total bang for your 400$. everything about it is great. especially for gaming. but i found that this greatness comes with one price: build quality. sony obviously used cheaper materials to make it affordable. the joystick rubbers on the controllers tore apart after just a few weeks. the controller itself was broken open when i got home one day. dont know what happened but i found no cracks nor scratches on it so it could not have been ""hit"" hard. the console never moved from its place so its ok. but if i ever drop it, im pretty sure it gonna break like a glass.but for 400$, it pretty much justifies itself. the bottom line is it is WAY better in every aspect than its competitor: the xbox one

  Opened up my brand new console, came packeged in no bubble wrap, just came in a box that barely had any wiggle room, only had a piece of waded up paper for protection. Upon closer inspection, I found a couple small scratches on the front. Otherwise, it looked brand new. Is this a used unit? Anyhoo, hooked it up, according to directions. After setup, I edited my profile. Then after a moment, the screen slowly went black, from the center outwards. Then the screen came back to normal after 10 secounds or so. Played my non-online game, and didn't experience any issues for the 2 hours I played. Don't know if I will need to return this or not. Will update soon.Update 2/10/16No problems or anomalies have occurred since first day of use.

  Cons:Touch buttons on the console... you'll accidentally activate them.The controller battery doesn't seem to last that long, especially if you have a headset plugged in.  I wish it took rechargeable AAs which would be quick to change out.As of the current firmware, even when plugged into the console with an USB cable the controller still communicates through Bluetooth.  This is a problem if the 2.4GHz bands are already busy around you, also a problem for tournaments.Other than that it's been awesome.

With programs like Netflix, Youtube among others, there are multiple uses for the PS4 besides it just being a video game console. The ability to share achievements/accomplishments on twitter, facebook etc is an added bonus and streaming isn't all that hard if you choose to do that. I got the system about 2 months ago and still have not gotten around to every single detail of the PS4, there is just plenty to do.The PS4 also has great app support for your typical TV-watching type of apps (Netflix, Hulu, Amazon). I have a smart TV and used to use the apps built in to that to watch TV, but the experience is not only much faster on the PS4, it has some cool features that my TV doesn't like auto-play and adjustable subtitles. I use the apps more than I play games.I am very pleased with my purchase of a PS4 and got a very good deal with this. Me personally, I would say this is the best buy of the ""Big 3"" systems if you are choosing to get one. Sony has consistently provided good console exclusive after good console exclusive and given this is still a relatively new system for the most part, it is a good investment.Getting one of the best games in my opinion bundled with this system is like the cherry on top. The Last of Us is a brutal, violent, heart throbbing game that takes you on an adventure that you don't ever want to get off of. The game is not for everybody but survival horror fans and people who enjoy a compelling story will fall in love with this game. It comes inside as a free digital download so don't miss out on playing what is, you know, absolutely free.

  My first unit was DOA, then the replacement arrived and is pure greatness, the system is smooth as you can imagine. The games are awesome, i own all playstations, and this is the best one so far. I also had a broken PS2 and PS3, and my Xbox 360 got 3RL, so it was not a surprise my unit came DOA, but sure extremely bummer and sad. Now i just hope it lasts the whole generation.just give us more games, trully next gen games and not ports and cross gen. (the next gen is only beginning.)

  Easiest console setup ever. The machine is quiet, powerful, and gets the job of playing games done beautifully.PROS:1. The new controller is so much better than the previous ones! Its comfortable, and I love the innovation of the touchpad on the front, it works like a button when pressed down as well.2. Its quiet, no Xbox 360 levels of turbine power involved.3. Its got most video streaming services available out of the box with a quick download.4. Most of the games available run in native 1080p, which means much prettier games!5. The audio out on the controller is an awesome little feature! I never realized how nice this would be when sharing the room with my girlfriend, I just pop in my iphone earbuds and play away.6. Twitch streaming is awesome! Admittedly unless you're playing something you're very good at or competing people won't watch your stream.CONS:1. Controller battery life. Its a little short. Had to put it on to charge every day before I went to bed.2. Console seems to get hot, but no worse than my old 360 or PS3, but you should keep in mind when putting it in your entertainment center. I had to clear out enough room to give it space to circulate that hot air out.3. PSN seems to be flaky at the moment, but that will get sorted soon.

  Recently I picked up a ps4, as well as an xbox one. Since I'm a technology junkie, and buy just about every console that comes out- minus Nintendo .  As for the ps4, really nice build quality, console is small, sleek, quiet , and about 50% more powerful than the xbox . Gpu is 40% prior to ms announcing they reserve 10% for the kinect , and recently we discovered that the CPU is actually more powerful on ps4, as well.  When you discuss memory, ps4 is using 8gb of the new gddr5 memory, where as xbox one is using 8gb, of much slower DDR3 memory. What this means is the ps4 can transfer data to gpu/ CPU at 176gbps, where as xbox one is at 68gbps. Xbox one tries to close this gap by using 1/3 of gb (.32 to be exact ) of esram which allows data transfer at 102gbps, but keep in mind this is .32gb, so of the whole 8gb, this is only 1/3 of 1gb. These are just a few examples as to why ps 4 is running most games at 1080p, and quite a few of these same games run at 720p on xbox one . As for the ps4, the new GUI is blazing fast . I had a ps3, and it's lightning fast in comparison . Sony has really upped their game with this system , I also feel that sony is closing the gap with their online structure. Psn is really becoming a good service . I don't want this to seem like I don't like my xbox one, cause it's a good system as well, I think Microsoft is just much for focused on a media box than a game system . Should be interesting to see how the next couple years shake out.

  System looks great, HDMI ports work fine software update went good. everything was easy to setup and I did use the Sony HDMI cable.. All the apps I installed worked, my unit comes from the FOX plant in China, I purchased it on the Amazon midnight launch deal Thursday night.. I have played Assassins Creed and it looks great... I had pre-ordered an Xbox one but decided to get the PS4 instead, I didn't need all the Social network media crap that comes with these systems, I wanted a powerful gaming machine and because of the internal hardware the PS4 was my choice and I don't regret it.

  Wonderful console and excellent service from Amazon from beginning to end. No hardware issues, the games look amazing and I got it on release day just as Amazon promised.I will definitely be ordering my next console from Amazon!1. Preorderd Watch Dogs Bundle in July (Amazon does not charge credit card until delivery)2. Watch Dogs gets delayed until 2014, Amazon offers $10 credit and let me keep my preorder3. Target has Buy 2 get 1 free sale on PS4 games during launch week, Amazon offers same deal at launchMy review for the console is 5 stars, and my review for Amazon is 5 stars. If you are like me, you already know if you want a PS4 or an XBOXone, so instead of trying to sell you on the PS4, I'd rather give you my experience with Amazon. They are great and will do whatever it takes to make their customers happy.

  Ordered at midnight on launch night and arrived before they even gauranteed it. Console performs great, love the ""dashboard"" (sorry im used to referencing the xbox) as i had no difficulties finding anything i was looking for in the menus. Overall very satisfied with the product. My only gripe has to do with Amazons shipping packaging, as it was at least 3 times the size of the ps4 in depth without any packing materials such as air bags or packing peanuts. There was no physical damage but thats never the whole story.  I am now a PS4 fan :)

  It is what I thought it'd be. Stable robust console that delivers graphics and sound that are second to none. The controller feels like it has substance not cheap feeling.  My only con it thst the L3 R3 buttons wear out fast or the rubber material starts peeling after a month of use.

  It's hard to find an objective review on this system with the usual console wars and fun-blocking going on but I'm going to give it to you straight from someone who has objectively looked at all of the negative reviews, rumors, and played at least 4 games (Knack, Lego Marvel Super Heroes, Assassin's Creed 4 and Skylanders Swap Force).PROS:-Small and sleek design. It fits vertically in the only space I had for it on my entertainment center ( a 3 inch wide ledge beside the TV.-Game discs load onto HDD for overall faster loading times.-Aside from some loading noises on start-up I never hear a peep out of it even after hours of gaming.-Games look and play absolutely beautifully!  Not a glitch or lag or issue in sight.-SHARE button!  Omg, if I ever get a glitch, I am going to LOVE having this to capture the fun!-the controller is PERFECT.  The material, the joystick grooves, the touch pad, all of it feels great.  I was worried it would be too big (I like smaller grips since I have small hands) but it is SO comfortable and only a tad bit wider than the DualShock 3.  This is a lightweight beauty made for long hours!  Touch pad complaints are that the click is generic (?); totally not seeing where that comes from.-power and eject buttons are terrific too.  No more holding it, hoping it's the right spot or searching for the damn thing.  Once you know where it is (and I appreciate the subtlety) you could find it in the dark.CONS:-The bad reviews!  I have seen everything from HDMI port malfunctions to blue screen (from faulty HDDs or update fixes, etc). and after the research, I see most of them are from pre-launch systems or just regular DOAs.  People, computers can come DOA; it's a downside to technology and it's why limited warranties are standard.  Merchants honor replacements or merchandisers will offer repairs-- it doesn't make that company dishonest and it's not a new concept.  That being said, read up on reviews and weigh the risks.  Make sure you buy from trusted sources and stop blaming companies for expected issues.-I still wish launch systems always bundled two controllers, but that's an old-school gripe.I should probably have more cons directly related to the system, but honestly, I have found nothing bad about the PS4 so far.  Launch systems have always been a shaky affair but this one has really eased my mind.  This is a gamer's console, without a doubt, and I am a single-player kind of gamer so this is a dream.  I'm sure the online aspects are terrific but that's not my scene.  All I know is that I am absolutely satisfied with my first week of experience with the PS4 and it 100% fits my needs.  The interface is beautiful, the loading and menus are really easy to get used to, the games run seamlessly and look spectacular.  I couldn't ask for more in a system.

  The playstation 4 has so far won the beggining of this generation of consoles and their war for dominance, but I am not partial to any of the consoles as they all have their unique traits. Personally, I enjoy the PS4 for its sleek design, zippity fast software and the controller. I am in love with the touchpad and the adjusted button layout. The only issue I have with this console, technically no longer falls under the console itself, but rather the manufacturer/provider. I think Sony should have stayed completely F2P with their online services Becoming money hungry like Microsoft and charging $59.99/yr to play online was the wrong move. Honestly they should have kept online multiplayer free and just kept Playstation Plus as an additional option. I highly doubt this would effect their standings in the fight for top console.

  The Playstation 4 would be amazing if one thing was fixed: the wifi card in it. With my location in my house, it isn't possible to be connected through ethernet all the time. My internet speeds are above average and works fine for everything else, but I consistently have issues with the PS4.After updating to firmware 2.0, the problems only worsened and now I can't connect to PSN at least twice a week. Playstation is unwilling to help and always says it is on your end when clearly it isn't. Be sure you have a stable ethernet connection if you plan on buying this, or it very well may be useless half the time you own it.

  I made the plunge and purchased this piece of equipment after already owning the Wii U and a PS3 from the ""previous"" generation. I'm glad I did. I love the new controller, new user interface, etc... While yes, right now the games are lacking, there are more great ones on the way. Currently I've had no problems with this machine, and I can't wait until the new games come out. I've seen how some people have had problems with this turning on and the so called ""blue light of death"" but haven't had this problem, so I can't comment on it.Take the plunge into next gen, it's well worth it.

  First of all, I am from China. PlayStation has been forbidden to sell here since 13 years ago. Thanks Amazon US for providing the direct mailing to China, so we Chinese TV game fans are able to play PS4 like everyone else in the world.Thanks DHL, it took only 6 days to deliver PS4 to me from US to China. The interesting thing is I found PS4 was made in China :-) That's to say, we have to buy something actually made by ourselves from abroad. Little ironic, isn't it?Let's talk about the PS4 itself. In my point of view, it's well designed and it has very impressive looking for me. I haven't got the ""blue light"" issue yet, and I wish i won't have it ever. Assassin creed 4 is the sole game I bought so far (I am waiting for Uncharted 4), and I think PS4 is obviously much better than PS3 in every criteria except games. I have to complain there are not enough good PS4 games at this point, so Sony please, we need more big games in 2014.Good job Sony! I give 5 stars.

  I've had the luxury of owning both the PS4 and Xbox One. Before I start any console war, I just want to say that the Xbox One is not a bad console. I just personally like the PS4 more. When I received it, one of the controllers had a defect and was not working properly. I called Amazon and told them the problem, and they immediately sent me a new controller. Excellent customer service. Other than that, I have had no problems with this PS4. Sony has outdone themselves this time around and I think that's evident by the sales numbers. If you're thinking about purchasing this for yourself or a family member for the holidays, don't hesitate. You/they will not be disappointed. Merry Christmas!

  Amazing system right out of the box. Best launch titles I've experienced in a long time, and a beautiful piece of hardware. Have been playing all weekend (since launch), including Knack, Killzone, Assassin's Creed, Resogun, and more. All of them are stunning.The games that stand out for me in particular are Knack and Resogun - both are very addictive and highly polished. Knack feels like playing a Dreamworks movie, and the hop-in co-op feature really puts that extra DualShock 4 controller I bought to good use. I am really hoping to get into Killzone and Assassin's Creed more (Killzone is especially impressive), but I also just received my Need for Speed Rivals pre-order, so I suspect I will find myself split.Speaking of the DS4 - it is a remarkable improvement to the PlayStation controller line. My fiance is incredibly impressed by how comfortable it is, and the fact that we both agree - even me with my large mitts - shows how much effort was put into the ergonomics of the controller. The weight and size feels perfect, and really does the system as a whole justice. One really neat feature, that gets glanced over in some reviews, is the ability to plug any standard headphones into the controller and pump all of the system audio through the controller, wirelessly. No delay, either. I've been using my iPhone earpods (later version), and the quality is great. Microphone works well too. When not using the headphones, the speaker on the controller adds a layer of depth to games like Knack and Resogun that is a real treat.One really awesome feature that we didn't realize from all of the pre-release reviews is that each controller can be assigned to a user, and that user can be connected to a PSN account. Whenever you turn on a controller, it asks ""who's using this controller?"". Which ever account you pick, that person will log in. In a game like Knack, both me and my roommate have our own PSN accounts and are both logged in. Depending on which controller is used to launch the game, that user is the primary player and is playing to earn trophies on their profile. Each user, though, has their own ""home screen"", meaning at any time I can press the PS button on the controller and go to MY home screen, see my friends, change my settings, etc. During this time my roommate can't interact with the screen - it's my home screen after all. We can hop back into the game quickly, or he can press the PS button on his controller and go into his homescreen, where he gets to interact with his friends, change his settings, etc. Because we're both logged in, the status of both of our accounts is ""Playing Knack"". It's a fantastic way to utilize the account system and tie it directly with a controller. If we're playing with his game save, and he is earning trophies for his account, as soon as he wants to stop, he can end the game and put his controller down and I can go to my homescreen with the PS button and launch a new game. I am instantly using my account and earning trophies for me, now, without having to log out of the system first or changing which controller is ""Controller 1"". It is one of the stand out features of the system for us.Owning a Vita, the remote play has been excellent. There isn't much use for the second screen option yet, but I believe there will be soon. Using the PS App on my iPhone has been excellent, too. Using my phone to type is much easier than the controller, and really rounds out the ecosystem. If you have a PlayStation console, you definitely want the PS App. Using it to add and message friends is a timesaver.Hoping to be a clairvoyant voice among the angry mob - my system has experienced ZERO issues, and neither have my friends (old and new, IRL and online). Set up was a breeze, update was painless, and the time it took from opening the box to playing a game was literately minutes. Games download and install insanely quick - as someone who has been 'ok' with the PS3s tortoise-like crawl, the PS4 is like going from dial-up to Fiber. I cannot reiterate enough how quick and easy this system is to get running.

  Little bit about me. Ive owned all sony systems and the first 2 from microsoft but prefer sony and its exclusive. I will break this review down by what I have.ps4-awesome machine, so much faster than the ps3 and I love the new ui not cluttered and easy to fine what im looking for. Love that theres no waiting to install and you can hop right into gameplay. I dont use features like music or netflix but theyre theyre if I need them which is nice.killzone shadows fall-it looks fantastic needs to be seen in motion to be understood. If youve played killzone before this Is more of the same. I enjoy the story have not tried multiplayer.knack-i like this one alot also its a return to difficult platformers. The story is decent and the graphics are good. It could have been better and maybe a sequal will be what this could have been.assassins creed 4-i waited to play this on ps4 but my friend has the ps3 version and I watched him play a little from the start. After seeing him play then playing the ps4 version theyre is a really is a differance! Longer draw distance and brighter colors.need for speed- love the new need for speed the graphics are great and the cars look great. Its similar to most wanted and hot pursuit.call of duty- looks marginally better in ps4 gamplay is exactly the same.you need to sign up for plus with ps4 to play online in doing so you can get 2 free games the one I got are,resogun- fully expected to hate this game as its made by stardust alumni and I hated stardust. I watched video and it did not impress me. I saw the high praise It was getting and decided its free ill try it. OMG this game is fun ive spent more time on this than any other and have been singing its praises to my friends. Great game and again its free. If youve ever played defender on an atari its very similar but very addicting.contrast- I have this but have not tried as of yet.then there's the basic stuff,controller- markedly improved love this thing so much. Best controller yet and am considering using these for my ps3 from now on. Buttons feel great weight feels great. I enjoy the speaker being on it its neat and adda depth.earbud- works like it should but serious online gamers will need/want better and should get it. This is flimsy as and functional but thats it.camera- havnt hooked up yet but its nicely made.overall im liking this system alot and the future is bright for it. I am gonna get thief and infamous and I cant wait to see what naughty dog does. I would also like to see a new resistance.

  So far, I am REALLY enjoying the sound and picture quality of the games, and being able to also use it as a blu-ray player (since mine just crapped out on me).I just wish that Sony would come out with a decent remote to use specifically for movies.  Yes, you can use the game controller, but it takes a lot of guess-work to figure out which buttons do what.My friend who is a fellow gamer and Sony Playstation lover was very impressed with this new system and how vividly clear the graphics are.  We were playing the new Assassins' Creed Unity on it.  The graphics are so clear that the people look real, as if you are watching a movie.

  Finally!! after months of anticipation I finally got my unit, It has met and surpassed my expectations, the user interface is very smooth and slick. Very snappy and 0 lag. You can effortlessly go to the PS store, buy digital content, snap back to your game and let it download and install all content on the background. Then you have the slick look of the console, for a bran new 2013 console, with the power it packs, Im quite impressed as to how well design it was. No power brick, smaller than my PS3 slim, and shorter too. The controller is a huge improvement over the PS3 dualshock, big plus on that one. Im currently playing Battlefield 4 and Killzone and wow the graphics are top notch, those internet videos dont do justice to the games, you really got to see it to believe it. My only complain if any is the fact the the USB ports are now on the right instead of the left, for me its a small inconvenience because of my home theater set up. Anyway the Playstation 4 exceeded my expectations and for only $400 its more than worth the price. It has a potential as well.

  Had to drive an hour away a week and a half ago when no one had ps4s to get find one in a Gamestop, was so impressed that I decided I needed to get another(gf and I play and both of us hate splitscreen).  Once Amazon got them back in stock was the perfect time to pull the trigger on the premier gaming system of this generation.  Graphics are incredible even though I've only played Ghosts, which wasn't really developed for next gen usage.  Love the controller, has a great feel and texture and I love the true triggers on top.  Interface and speed among the OS is much improved on the PS3 and will only get better when themes and more content is released.  All in all I couldn't get happier with both my ps4s and I feel they are great value for the 400 asking price!  Once more great exclusive games come out this system will further distance itself from the XBox dONE.

  Let me say that this is my second PS4.  I bought one for Xmas but it was DOA.  I sent it back to Amazon and waited a bit before I bought another one, from Amazon.  I was going to give it 4 stars because of the first one, but I understand that every now and then a product will have an issue or two, especially a new one.With that said, this console was super easy to get up and running.  It does take a bit long to load a game, but so does my Xbox One, and I only load games once so that is no big deal.  The graphics are very, very good, extremely sharp.  The controller feels good in my hands, and the interface is simple, fast and clean.  The console is quiet and does not heat up much during use.I'm not a huge baseball fan, but I love playing MLB on this console, the graphics are off the chart good.  I also like the overall design of the console.  It is slim, with no power brick and thus easier to make room for as opposed to my Xbox One.  All in all, a great console and I am looking forward to the new games that will be available shortly for the PS4.On a side note, as you can tell I also own the Xbox One, which I also got for Xmas.  Both consoles are hooked to my big screen Samsung TV, as well as (via HDMI hub/switch) my new LG 34UM95.....which I absolutely love by the way.  To this day, I really do not know which console I like more.  Some days I use the PS4 and other days its the Xbox One.  I am not a ""fanboy"" of either, in fact I did not even know what the term meant until I started reading reviews for these consoles.  I like the simplicity and cleanness of the PS4 interface.  I like the extra functionality of the Xbox One, that goes beyond gaming.  I like them both, and glad I have them both.

  Very nice product! Does everything it advertises. Not a lot of games to play on it yet, but that is normal for a launch. No 3D support yet, kids were disappointed when they went to watch Avengers in 3D last night and it couldn't. That will probably be patched in at a later date.

  Been looking for ps4 since it was release and it was sold out all over, finally amazon got it, and there was my change to get one...shipping was fast, had little issue with hdmi, the moment i go from hdmi to tv then go back to hdmi the screen would go black, right there and then i thought something was wrong with my ps4, but it was as simple as moving the hdmi cable from hdmi 1, to hdmi2 and it worked with no problem. Powerful console love it i own all ps consoles this one is incredibly....couldn't be happier, no issues whats so ever.

  I am in love with this console.The graphics are amazing.  I love the look of the games on this system.  The sound is impeccable.  We run it off a 7.1 surround system, and I've had moments where a twig will snap behind me, or a beast will roar off to the left.  It is a bit more precise that I'm used to in how it handles locating sound between speakers, by firing both off but not at the same volume.  I really love that.The controller is so comfortable.  I had some problems early on with the rubber coming off, but each time Sony was great about quickly replacing the controller.  The audio jack on the controller means even the most basic headset can be effectively wireless for gaming.  I did not think I would like the touchpad, but now I love it.  It has an accelerometer, so for Infamous: Second Son, when you are using the controller like a can of spray paint, you have to turn it sideways and shake it.  And the embedded speakers are such, it sounds like a can of spray paint being shaken.  The PS3 controller always bothered me a little that it is too easy to inadvertently push down the left thumbpad (so it thinks you hit L3) when you are trying to run around.  I've yet to encounter that problem with this one, not even doing the various rundown sections of Assassin's Creed: Black Flag.Sharing in-game video is quick and easy.  It works so well, and so fast.  I didn't think I would use that, but it turns out I kind of like sharing awesome moments on Facebook.  I'm very much a solo gamer, and the library for that is still very impressive.If you have PlayStation Plus, your games are backed up online.  When I upgraded the hard drive, which is ridiculously simple, I just redownloaded my games, already in progress.  It picked up where it left out without a hitch.For stability, for elegance, for performance, and most importantly, for incredible game play, I give the PS4 five stars.

They've also fixed the controller buttons so they won't peel and that's awesome.

  First thing you notice is just how small it is. It's smaller than any version of the PS3 (even the ""super slim"" model) ever made, and slides into a home theater stack far more easily.The back has a standard ports: HDMI, Ethernet, optical audio out, and a proprietary socket for the optional PlayStation Camera. All you need are two cables — power and HDMI. VERY EASY!Controller: Easy to hold, light weight, USB powered... best controller I've held.Start screen: Easy to navigate - a good update from the PS3. The only flaw is the web browser. Sony just can't seem to get this right. Still, the Netflix app is solid.  Really though, who browses the web on their PS4?!Games: As mentioned above, the browser is not good, but you're not buying this to browse the web.  Simply put - the games look amazing.  Full 1080p - better than anything I've seen. I won't go into reviewing the games - a picture is worth a thousand words.Summary - If you want the best gaming platform out there - this is for you.  You may also want to upgrade your TV to get the full experience.

  I am a multi-console owner who also has a Xbox One (see my profile for Xbox One review). I was a huge supporter of the PS3/360/Wii and have the Wii U. I have to say of all 3 this is my favorite console of the next gen consoles. Why is that? It is simple in its user interface. It improves on the extended media bar by making adding another layer on top of it. Its like one media bar on top of the other. There is a lot of social aspects added into it that track your friends progress, not just by trophies but my special accomplishments and what they are watching. The trophies are now more special by giving an indication how rare they are. A new aspect is streaming your game live or making clips to post for others to see. It is easy to use and has a sleek simple interface.The controller is easily the most important aspect of the system. I am proud to see this is my favorite controller if this generation. It is very sturdy in the whole design, especially the triggers and the analog sticks. They are extremely tight which makes them feel they will last a long time. I was surprised how loose the PS3's analog sticks are in comparison and even compared to the Xbox One's controller. The speaker on the controller is loud and clear, more so than speaker in the wii-mote. The touch pad works smoothly and nice in games like Killzone: Shadow Fall.Now if anyone doesn't know, the PS4 is the most powerful console. It doesn't mean all games will look better than the competition but majority will. It was built with a lot of developer input and designed to get away from the difficult ridiculous design of past Playstation development tools which hampered it from being able to have the best version of games and not having enough RAM to compete to have the same quality of titles in games such as Fallout 3 and Skyrim. Sony has answered this with DDR5. It also has some of the leading developers such as Naughty Dog, Media Molecule, Sony Santa Monica, Quantum Dreams, and Sucker Punch.If you want the most powerful system, a greatly improved controller for FPS games. A console that innovates and takes rich with new IPs such as Flower, Journey, Unfinished Swan, and the LittleBIGPlanet than Sony is the choice who takes the lead and doing so with new games like Octodad, Rosogun (the best next gen game right now), and a lot of other indies but also one who provides a trend of bringing new big AAA experiences such as The Last of Us, Infamous, Uncharted, than the PS4 is a good choice. That trend is continuing with new games such as The Order: 1886 and old ones such as Uncharted 4 and Infamous: Second Son.Games Played (and own) on PS4:ResogunBattlefield 4 (beaten)Killzone: Shadow Fall (beaten)Assassin's Creed: Black Flag

  Received my PS4 on Friday and so far it's all been good. It's great to finally have a console capable of 1080p. The new interface is solid, I really like the whats new addition so I can see what my friends have done. PSN is still a little limited, but come on, it's a launch, many things are NEVER available at launch. Just like consoles before it, it should have most of its features live in a year. I purchased it mainly to have the upgraded multiplats now, and know that in the future great games will be coming, Sony has great first party studios. Killzone is solid and Infamous is coming in spring. As far as first party shows, look at the PS2 and PS3, sony has never failed at delivering quality First Party games.And another note, my PS4 has been working fine, been playing BF4, Resogun and Ghosts all weekend and have clocked 15+ hours on it. It has already outlived my Launch PS3 and 360 consoles. Also it's nice to see party chat finally come to PSN, and it's also great that you get Resogun for free if you subscribe to PSN+, which I already had anyway.I'm reviewing this on based a Launch system, but also on what will eventually turn into a great console as the future unfolds with time. I'm very excited to see what the future holds.

  First I must give a shout out to Amazon for keeping my reservation for the PS4. I was due to have my PS4 delivered to me on Friday 11/15/13. They attempted to charge my card on Thursday 11/14/13 but I did not get paid (Direct Deposit) until Midnight leading into Friday. They could have easily canceled my reservation and said good luck on getting a PS4 now or anytime soon. Amazon sent me an email letting me know that they tried to make the transaction go through but they couldn’t. They told me I had 3 days to pay for the item or my order would be canceled. Fortunately I didn’t even need the 3 days, my transaction went through on Friday and they shipped it out Friday. I would have received it Saturday but I was getting my PS4 delivered to my job (Nope I’m not trusting this to get delivered at my house while no one is there) and my job is closed on the weekends. So I did get it Monday 11/18/13. So I was able to live for 2 more days. So again, big ups to AMAZON for their customer service.The PS4 games on this console is strikingly beautiful. There is a major decrease in loading time when it comes to playing games, streaming Netflix, or Hulu, ect versus the PS3. They do come with an earpiece that looks a little on the cheap side but you can hear your on-line buddies just fine.  They do have the option of putting your PS4 in a “very low” power mode, and during this time you can have your controller attached charging up for the next time you play. I love the freebee games they give you (When you sign up for Play station Plus). Make sure you download “RESOGUN” soooooooo freakin awesome.!!!!!

Overall it's a good system and would recommend to all my friends. I only have 3 games but so far I enjoy this new system.  Definitely an upgrade from the PS3

  I've been an xbox guy since the first xbox. I have never owned any playstations in the past till now. After reading reviews and opinions on both the PS4 and XB1 for the last 2 months and playing both  I decided on the PS4  and I'm not disappointed at all. Looks great, performs great and I even prefer the controller over my 360's controller which is crazy because one of the main reasons I've never liked playstations was due to the controller. I will miss the Halo series (what got me to buy the first xbox) but the PS4 is way more bang for your hard earned buck.

  My brother had gone for New Jerssy for a week(I'm in India), so I planned to order this through Amazon so that he can bring it back to India.  My review would be helpful for those Indians( or Asians) who would like to buy PS4 from States. Becuase here in India it costs double the cost that of in US.I ordered this on Saturday evening 4pm(India time), i.e saturday morning 6.30am in NJ (my shipping address).The package was delivered to my brothers office Monday morning around 11am. That was very quick. I was worried they will take like4-5 days so my brother would  miss the package. But yeah he got in time and he took a picture and sent me through whatsapp. It was well packed.  He did unboxing in his hotel room and I,m not sure if they added any bubblewraps or something.I was worried about following things,1) If I get a DOA PS4, then all I can do is make a youtube video on break your PS4 or drop your PS4 or something. since Sony has told that warranty would be void if we import PS4 from US. (although they are ready to replace PS4 with another $399)2) Power statistics. India has 240v/50Hz , and US is 120v, 60Hz.3)Indian Customs, who are waiting for bribes from international travels who bring electronic items and golds.Solutions,1) Thankfull, My PS4 turned on perfectly and day1 update was perfect  and everything went reall well. I read  that Amazon had lot of broken PS4, but mine was a success story. I could not find any faults.2)I saw a youtube video that eventhough the USA Ps4 power number is written 120 only, it still works with asian powers.So with name of God I hooked the power and it was fine. I did not need a step down trasformer or something.3) My bro packed it in luggage bag and somehow he escaped the customs!! so around 100-200 USD save there .I bought a APC UPS for my PS4 and it works great with it, I have been playing watchdogs for quiet and while and I love the performance.I'm very very happy with the product and I love it. Works like Magic. I saved around $300 by purchasing it from Amazon USA.

  I purchased this console in November of 2014 to play Dragon Age Inquisition. I have to say that in the few years that I've been gaming, I have never used such a great console. It's really easy to set up (in my opinion), and the home screen is pretty sleek looking. The only bad thing I can really say about it is that dust can collect more easily than my PS3. I think I'll have to invest in a PS4 stand to help with that. The only real downside to this console is the selection of games. Right now I own all of 2-3 games on the console. I do look forward to new games being released.

  I keep falling more and more in love with this system.  I was skeptical in the beginning, not think they could improve on the experience much more than the PS3.  They did.  The graphics are very impressive and the overall functionality of the unit is great.  Couple that with some really cool free games offered (Resogun and Contrast) and you've got a winner.  Most exciting thing about the console is that, developers are still learning what they can really accomplish with this new powerful system.  The games are only going to get more complex and better over the next couple of years!

  I was a little worried with the BLOD but my system worked right out of the box. I had also bought one for a co-worker and no problems there. The thing I like the best with the new system is the seamless UI as it is super fast now and you can just press the playstation button to go out of a game into the main menu or between different loaded games. I also love that you can play the game as soon as you put in the disc without little to no loading times as the game loads in the background as you play it. I haven't tried the social functions like streaming your gameplay yet but I hear it works great. I hope they allow for it to be done to Youtube and not just facebook as I don't have an account there. Unfortunately the entertainment functions are limited no CD, MP3's and DLNA at this time. It doesn't even recognize my flash drive. Sony is supposeto patch these later on(well no confirmation on DLNA) as well as being able to use my Pulse headset. I hope they do this in the next few months as these should be basic functions.Overall if you want a game machine I would get the PS4 due to better GPU and CPU than other consoles in the market combined with the social functions and of course top rated exclusive games that will be coming in the next year from Sucker Punch and Naughy Dog. I have no regrets in this purchase and would recommend this console over the others for people trying to move up to the next generation of gaming.

  One thing Im not sure people mentioned is their networking account system. Coming from Xbox, most games wouldn't let you play with others on different accounts (family/friends) online on the same xbox unless they have Xbox live or they use guest. I know for some the guest makes you feel less of a part of the community, no individuality but rather the butt buddy of another.  Sony is similar with their paying system for pan+ vs xbl, except if one person has the psn+ (PlayStation network plus) on their main system, then anybody can use their account on that system and gain the online gameplay priveliges and most benifits as if they had psn. By this I dont mean only when the other person is logged in, but even if the psn+ owner is off.  That made me respect sony and enjoy my PlayStation all the more. I felt they weren't only out to eat my pockets but also looking to give what I'm paying for. I recommend
