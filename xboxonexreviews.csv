  I get it. Supply and demand, but seriously? Literally triple the price? PC master race... here I come... Get a nitro 5 instead of this deal. The entire reason consoles were so popular were the affordability. By all means, if you can buy it, it's a great machine. It seems like we are all beta testers and game companies are just releasing garbage games and fixing the issues on their time... simple fixes take months not days. Smh.

  It’s a behemoth simple put. Besides that it is a really amazing console. Just setting it up and downloading a few games for my son, I could really notice the download speed and performance upgrades. Does not run hot so far it has been running terratech in 4K hdr for about half hour. See picture. The Xbox one x would easily hit 150 degrees Fahrenheit.

  Let me start off by saying I am not an Xbox fan boy lol. I have mostly played PS4 and PC  in the past few years. I was very intrigued with Xbox series X because of the user experience. They really seem like they were listening with this generation and it shows. The UI interface is like butter it moves so quickly, with hardly any waiting. Game pass which is an amazing option only on Xbox and PC has an amazing selection of games right at my fingertips for a monthly fee. Xbox really got the user experience down I can honestly say that it was definitely worth it. I've been enjoying a lot of games that I played on PC and I am confident in saying that I have such a great experience on Xbox series X I'm blown away. It gets a little hot but I have it in a very breathable location. ( I would recommend that as well ) I'm excited to play all the Xbox one games I missed out on! (And new games of course) Overall I really recommend it.

  What the console can do is good, but there is no new exclusives games for launch. I feel that’s a huge loss for Microsoft. Not really any reason to get this console until sometime next year when there will be some exclusives. The looks of this console doesn’t feel next gen and not a fan of how the insides are built/put together. Going to be a massive pain to clean this thing.

  To start off I would consider myself not a pro gamer, but definitely not a casual. I’m some where in between hardcore & Pro gamer. I got some insight on specs etc. This review will not be about the specs because we already know it’s damn better than last gen console Xbox One X.After a terrible, terrible, terrible...... the worst preorder experience of my life. I’m not joking. This generation of consoles preorders will go down in gaming history infamy because how bad it was, especially during our pandemic. I was as excited as I ever could be to receive this item as if I was a child all over again. And to top it all off it came 9 hours earlier on release day! I call that a significant win for preorder delivery, since this is my first time preordering a console online.Now for what your really here for, the console review. Personally, I love it. Load times are significantly faster! Games look so damn good! And total backwards compatibility with this console made me cry tears of joy. A true 4k experience. Something last generation promised us that didn’t happen.Now not anything is perfect. The one huge downside is there are no new games for this system yet. Usually there will be about 5 to 10 day one (some exclusive only to console) games. This year there’s basically 0. Yes, the positive spin on this is you have a while back catalog of older games you can play on this newer system and see the graphics ramped up. But as an avid gamer I am a Little disappointed that Microsoft the back big time even during pandemic that they couldn’t even offer at least 3 day one games. Sony is the same. These consoles will not have new games coming out day 1 unfortunately. We’ll have to wait till a little more in 2021 to expect the games we really want.If you want a more in-depth review you can head right on over to my YouTube channel where you can see an extensive review on the console today at 8pm central standard time. My dad and puppy will be on. It’l is going to be hilarious and cute. My channels name is Clive Childress. Come check it out of your interested to know more.All in all though this console is stellar. And I can’t fault the company for the pandemic situations. So with all that said this is a pretty great console.

  I've been playing Xbox since the OG version back in the early 2000's, the 360 was a nice leap from that OG version, the One was a good evolution from the 360, and now the XSX is further refinement. There's nothing really revolutionary especially if you're coming from the Xbox One X that had a powerful GPU already.Launch game list is atrocious, nothing really great to captivate the Xbox faithful. In the month and a half that I've had this console I've played Rocket League, Cyberpunk, Ori, GOW 5, Gears Tactics - they look nice but really can't see a difference compared to my One X graphically. Of course, there's the much better load times, instant game boot up and general quitness to the console which are a great improvement but is it worth $500 over the $500 I paid 2-3 years ago for the One X? Not really.Overall, I am an early adopter of tech, I've had all the day one editions since the 360 so I am a beta tester of sorts - I do anticipate the XSX to get better starting in 2021 with more first party games takind advantage of the the strong GPU and SSD performance. But for now, if you're a casual gamer like me or have the Xbox One X I would say to hold off until mid-late 2021. If you are rocking the Xbox One or Xbox One S then this is a worthy upgrade just for the visual upgrades and speed improvements.I play on a 65"" LG CX Oled TV via HDMI 2.1 cable, hopefully in 2021 more TVs are able to take advantage of all the tech the XSX offers for cheaper.

  I've grown up mostly a Playstation gamer...ps1 to ps4. I had and enjoyed xbox 360 but PS was my go to.  That all changed when I bought the xbox one x and tried gamepass. What a game changer that combo was for me quite literally. The one x played 3rd party games better than the competition and gamepass was an incredible value. Backward compatibility was the bonus. I loved it.Series X continues that power and value proposition without the mistakes xbox made with the xbox one launch. Microsoft and xbox have really turned it around and have once again produced the monolith of power with Series x.Fast ssd, super smooth menus, 1440p/4k support, variable refresh rate, auto low latency, hard drive support, backwards compatible with games and accessories, gamepass, games optimized for series x or s, familiar yet just better controller, external ssd expansion card available, auto hdr... you get the drift.The series X is best most complete xbox I dare say ever produced. If your already an xbox gamer its a no brainer to upgrade... if your thinking about making the switch... this is the best xbox to get onto to.Its familiar yet improved in every way. The library of exclusives can and will get better but with optimized series x games and gamepass you'll be plenty busy.Happy gaming!

  I normally like to wait a bit before giving my review, but I just couldn't wait to mention some things here.This thing is silent. Like.. DEAD silent. My Xbox One X would get sorta loud running BO4 and no doubt would running Cold War, but this thing is very quiet, unless you lean up really close to the top.Contrary to some articles, this thing doesn't really get too hot either. It gets warm, obviously, but it's definitely not as bad as some sources say it is.The d-pad of the controller was a bit of a worry for me when I saw it in photos. But using it just feels so right. The inclusion of a USB-C slot on the controller is also a nice touch. I have mispressed the share button a few times, but when I get a feel for where it is, it's gonna be a game changer.My only gripe so far is that I'm worried something might get into the top part where the fan is and mess everything up. And the power cable felt a tad loose, but nothing worth fretting about too much.All in all, first impressions are really good. If I remember, I'll try to update in a couple months if anything changes. Definitely recommend if you're a fan of Xbox and console gaming as a whole.

  I will start by stating I know the risks of being one of the first to get new tech.  So take my review with a grain of salt.  If you are reading this 6 months from now you probably are fine.  I am giving 4 stars because I feel the early release pains are more on the company and not the product.My review is that the Xbox delivers on what it said it would.  It is crazy powerful and just runs games beautifully.... For the short amount of time it did that.  There I was, in the middle of a 10 kill Warzone Trios making sick comms, about to secure another W all while saying ""If they only knew it was on the new Xbox"" then all of a sudden... bewp... Series X Series-ly shut down out of no where.  Not just a casual bye, no, like an angry significant other coming in and saying ""You're still playing that game?!?"" and slamming the door in your face.  I tried a number of things to get the Xbox to come back to me.  I sang it a song, tucked it in, promised I would buy every Microsoft exclusive game.  But alas nothing worked.  I now have a very, plain looking, desk weight.  Now I get to go through the fun and lengthy warranty return process with good ol big brother Microsoft.  I will take solace in the few short hours I got to brag and make fun of the ""one'ers"" who couldn't get their hands on one, but will likely have a working console before I get my replacement.  C'EST LA VIE

  Heavy unit and big! But not as big as I imagined (pc gamer usually). Runs games smooth and responsive. The UI is much quicker than xbox one.Yakuza game looks beautiful on it. And waiting for cyber punk. The new controller doesn't work with some of my older recharge xbox one battery packs. Luckily. I have rechargeable AAs.Def feels like a nice upgrade from xbox one but if you dont have the money. Don't rush into buying one yet.

Really sucks, sent it in for repair/replacement this morning.Also, i dont like how it doesnt feel like an upgrade cause of the UI. I understand the xbox team has constantly been working on the XB1 UI to what they considered perfection but i dont know, i just wish the experience felt more new.Overrall i’m very happy for my purchase, i know im just an unlucky one

  So far not super impressed with this new Xbox. Yes it’s a sexy piece of electronic and seems built solid but the lack of launch games is disappointing. I also don’t see that much of a performance difference between my Xbox one x and this as far as speed etc. maybe because it’s due to lack of games but right now, they are way behind PS5 launch. Very disappointed and not so sure it’s worth the hype..

  Coming from an Xbox One X I can say this does feel like a next-gen leap, albeit not a huge one as of yet.The console is quiet, and the use of an SSD this generation means a very responsive UI and faster load times for games. There are a handful of Series X optimized games available but not a bunch. I bought Devil May Cry 5 Special Edition to go with this and the differences are noticeable. In addition to improved graphics and faster load times the Series X also beings Ray Tracing which made this particular game look even better.To summarize the console delivers on bringing a next-gen feel and if you have a One X already there are differences that make the purchase feel welcome. Granted, with the short supply of games out there using this to its fullest at this time, you would be forgiven for waiting a little longer to buy this. But for those that buy it now or plan to buy it, I can definitely recommend this.

  Have had major problems with this console. The disc drive doesn’t read discs after u turn the console off unless u eject and reinsert. Games like COD MW and Cold War lag incredibly bad to the point it’s unplayable due to the stuttering, yet when I try my Xbox one on the same tittles there is no lag at all. Lastly, my Xbox series x shuts completely down randomly in the middle of games - it’s done it 5 times sometimes back to back.Would not recommend buying until they patch all these problems (hopefully they can be patched

   I wish I was able to give the Series X 5 stars but Microsoft customer service has killed it for me.A couple hours after receiving my Xbox it froze and after rebooting small pixel sized green squares littered the screen. I attempted swapping cables, changing TVs, and performing factory resets. In the end the issue would not go away.I decided to see if I could get a replacement through Amazon. Unfortunately they are currently out of stock. So the only option they provided was a refund or gift card.So I decided to give Microsoft support a shot, hoping that I could send it in for repair and get a replacement. This is where my journey of jumping hoops began.Microsoft only option for phone support is to fill out a form to have them call you, which is fine most of the time. After completing the form I was told I would receive a call in 90 minutes. 3 hours later I receive a call that the queue is full and my request was canceled. I would need to try again the next day.Next morning at 7am I refill out the form and receive a call from a human 2 minutes later. Woohoo! I explain my issues and the steps I took to trouble shoot. The service agent sets up a service request and says that I'll receive an email with what to do next.After hanging up and waiting a bit of time I receive the email and my shipping address is completely wrong from what I had told him on the phone....... So I hop online and resubmit the form to be called and I'm told it will be a 90 minute wait this time. 3 hours later I receive a call from a rep. I explain the mistake that was made on my address and he says that he needs to put me on hold so that he can escalate the issue. After being put on hold for 30 minutes  I abruptly get hung up on.After waiting to see if I would get a call back with no success I resubmit a request to be called online again. 4 hours later I get a call that the queue is full and my request has been canceled. I will need to try again tomorrow. I've owned every Xbox console that's been release and I would consider myself a bit of a fan boy. I shouldn't be required to jump through hoops like this when something doesn't work properly. This is EXTREMELY frustrating as a customer and has soured me a bit on the release of this console that I was super excited for a few months back.

  Everything youve come to expect in a console launch. Polished hardware, subtle redesign of the included controller (1). Comes with a high speed hdmi 2.1 cable. The power brick is all internal and has a normal cable for power supply. If you are giving this as a holiday gift, consider powering it up before hand, it has approximately 900MB update to do right out of the box. The controller needs to be updated as well. You can use a smart phone and the xbox app to set up profiles and settings from your previous xbox one. You can also transfer your digital games from your xbox one over your own network instead of downloading them all from the xbox servers. Be warned! Digital game downloads can take hours to install depending on your internet connection.Great tech in this product. I like the future proof cables for when I decide to upgrade. Awesome form factor and it runs quiet and stays cool.Game pass is a must for xbox. Save thousands on games and have so many to choose from. With the latest additions of EA Play and Disney+ there is too much value for the consumer to pass up.

   Was working fine on the 1st day I got it. Used it for about 6 hours and I’ll say this console is a beast. Woke up the next day the console wouldn’t turn on at all tried all the troubleshooting steps and nothing. Decided to return it for my money back. Will wait until all the bugs are fixed with future series x consoles.

  Let me get the ugly out of the way first. The industry as a whole completely botched the release of this generation of consoles. Pandemic aside, supply was nowhere near adequate to demand and very likely should have waited until late Winter/early Spring 2021 to launch. Additionally, internet commerce infrastructure was wholly inadequate to handle orders, particularly ones plagued by shopping bots used by scalpers to scoop up the already limited supply and sell them for outrageous markups. Let's hope this was a learning experience for everyone, and measures are being put in place to avoid this from happening in the future. Since this isn't a review of the industry, it won't affect my final score. But it all bore saying nonetheless.Right then, that out of the way... Despite my September 22 pre-order being delayed delivery by a day, my Series X arrived on November 11. Microsoft did an admirable job with the packaging, and the unboxing felt like an event. Once you broke the transparent seals on the box, the lid lifted like a treasure chest, the XBox nestled in thick packing foam on either side and from the lid above. The console was carefully wrapped in thin black paper-foam with an black and green banner around it that boldly invited you to ""Power Your Dreams!""Set-up was a breeze. The Series X comes complete with HDMI 2.1 cable for 4K UHD display, power cord (and no ungainly brick this time), and of course the evolutionary Series controller. With everything connected, the first powerup was exciting. The new splash screen is powerful, reminiscent of the old THX sound intro that is truly amazing if you have the volume turned up. Once setup begins in earnest, you can continue either using the controller or by coupling the console with the new XBox app on your phone. I encountered a few issues using the phone app (which is still listed as a beta on the android market), so I continued the setup with the controller. It went without a hitch and plugged all my old XBox One settings in through the miracle of the Cloud. I also plugged in my external HDD, and it happily recognized all my old games.The user interface is like the return of a familiar old friend. It's very much like the latest iteration on the XBox One family, and you'll be right at home from the very beginning. I know a common complaint is that it didn't seem ""next gen enough"" for many, but there's something to be said for being able to navigate a new device without having to learn all the new nooks and crannies they've shuffled things into. The first thing you'll notice is how fast the UI is now. ""Snappy"" is a term often used to describe how it feels. There's no lag in moving from section to section, button presses register immediately and there's the sense that the whole UI has had a quiet yet unmistakable injection of horsepower. The store, rather than appearing tacked-on and sluggish, comes up post haste. Overall the system is very responsive, and a pleasure to use.Of course, the system really shines if you have Game Pass. Those new to XBox who take advantage of the Game Pass introductory offer will be treated to over a hundred titles you can immediately download and play. Additionally, EA Play and Microsoft teamed up, so the player has access to dozens more games from the EA library. Sports titles like Madden and FIFA, old school RPG's like the Dragon Age series and much more are at your fingertips. Many titles either already have been enhanced to take advantage of the Series S/X feature set, or are currently being updated for the very same.Now, all of this is to dance around the very obvious omission in the Series launch: a lack of original and unique launch titles. Halo Infinite was to be that vehicle for Microsoft, but after this Summer's lackluster presentation, the game was delayed until 2021. Its absence is keenly felt in the marketing and product packaging which still prominently features Master Chief as its launch mascot.That said, the future looks bright indeed for the XBox. Microsoft's manic acquisition of studios, not least of which is the still-pending Zenimax deal, promises some console exclusives that are truly ground-breaking. Between Bethesda's rich legacy in the Elder Scrolls and Fallout, Arkane and id Software, and much more, there is an embarrassment of riches on the horizon for XBox players, as well as PC and mobile gamers who plug into the Game Pass content conduit.That's all fine and well, but launch exclusives aside, how does it play games? The answer is, ""Quite well, actually!"" Those titles explicitly enhanced to take advantage of the new consoles' power are vibrant, buttery-smooth at 60 (or even 120 in some instances) frames per second, and a joy to both behold and to experience. Even older legacy titles from the original XBox and 360 eras can take advantage of the raw power that the Series brings to bear, with many benefiting from graphical upscaling, auto-HDR, and other behind-the-scenes enhancements. If you've been immersed for years in the XBox culture, you have likely amassed quite the library of games, the vast majority of which are playable on the new hardware.Finally, the new controller as has been mentioned previously, is more evolutionary than revolutionary. The back of the shell has a textured ""grippy"" new feel to it, as have the shoulder- and trigger buttons. The D-pad now features more of an 8-way control surface rather than the more familiar 4 cardinal directions. The sticks also have a slightly different feel and grip; not so much that it's unfamiliar, but it's noticeable nevertheless. A downside is Microsoft's insistence on not shipping the controller with a rechargeable battery. It takes two ""AA"" cells, and to be fair it's pretty conservative on power draw with a fresh pair of alkalines lasting a good many hours of play. And you can buy the branded recharge kit for an additional $25-ish, but seriously in this day and age, it should come as standard equipment. Luckily, the controller is so similar to the XBox One's controller, that many of the latter's add-ons work perfectly well on the new one. I swapped the recharge pack from my XBO's controller with no issue, and aside from requiring a USB-C cable rather than the older micro-USB connector, it works just fine. The same is true of the headset adapter that plugs into the bottom of the unit. It works without a hitch, which suits me just fine.OK, final verdict. The Series X is a great powerhouse of a next gen console. While Game Pass is a great deal and I can heartily recommend it, the new consoles are at time of launch a weapon in search of a war. With no new titles to really showcase the new features of the console, the whole experience, while somewhat satisfying, feels a bit hollow. I'm sure once the new titles start flowing in the coming months and years, the true value of the Series consoles will shine forth, but if it's a ""fear of missing out"" experience, I can honestly recommend you wait until availability and new titles can be brought together next year. For that reason, as of the date of writing this (November 22, 2020), I'm reserving one star from the review in the hopes that once those new titles arrive I can revise the review and give the XBox Series X the 5-stars it rightly deserves.Now if I could only get my hands on a Playstation 5... ugh. *rolls eyes*

  Great console, easy to set up (it's fast if you use the Xbox App didn't try the other normal way). If you're an everyday Xbox player, once set up, everything is familiar and ready to go. Truly feels like a PC upgrade more than a console upgrade with how smooth everything is.Also don't buy from scalpers, just wait, you're not missing anything even remotely worth the price they are charging.

  Design:Smaller than you expect for a console that has this kind of performance.Controller:Feels great in your hand, has better latency than any previous xbox controller. Pairs and connects to the Xbox when powering on nearly instantly, which is a nice improvement from previous controllers.Performance:The level of graphical quality, FPS, and speed of the SSD make this the best console on the market. It accomplishes this all while being dead quiet and impressively cool.Features:Microsoft's implementation of Quick Resume and the velocity architecture makes switching between multiple games a breeze and actually incentives you to try different titles. The thoughts of not wanting to load up a new game because it would take too long to load up are gone forever with this generation.Conclusion:Microsoft has pulled out all the stops hardware and OS-wise. Once next generation games come out, the Xbox Series X will be the best way to game for years to come.

  Sad to give this a poor review.  I received a launch day unit which worked for three days and apparently died overnight.  No obvious reason for the death of the system but it simply won't turn on again.  MS support is sadly poor - just a circular loop back to the same canned and deficient ""support"" page, and an option to request a repair on the unit.  Says there's 24 hour online support, but I can't actually get it for this issue.  Likely returning it instead of requesting a repair.Prior to the hardware failure I was happy with the system.  As expected, load times were quite good, games looked great and were fluid.

  Everything was great then it just turned off and now it will not come back on. Called Microsoft and they were no help at all. I have always had Xbox and have not had any real issues until now.Now when looking online you can find all kinds of people with the same issue.

  The size of the console is so compact, it runs whisper quiet and improves upon most backward compatible titles.4K HDR, 120 FPS, 1440P support, even Dolby vision is supported on the console.You will get about 800GB usable space from the SSD for your games. Eventually you may have to spill for the 1TB sea gate expansion card. However, the best thing to do is use a USB 3.0 external HDD for your older games and put the new games on your main SSD.Currently there is an issue with VRR via HDMI at 4K. Variable refresh rate on certain TVs like LG and Panasonic. Microsoft is aware and will patch this via a software update. In the meantime, you can either turn VRR off on your Xbox video settings or run it at 1440p/1080p which works fine.Gamepass is the best value in gaming right now, Destiny 2 and the new expansion are on it.UI is running butter smooth and games are launching instantly. Right now there aren’t many new releases of games, but as time goes on there will be more titles to take advantage of this beast.Microsoft made an amazing console that will only age better over time.

  I was very excited to receive my console on launch day after waiting 2 months from the pre-order. I was able to setup the console but it quickly died. The screen started flashing green then it shut off. After that it would either boot and then shut off after a minute or not boot at all. Lesson learned, don't buy the first generation of Microsoft's products!

  Over the years, I've invested in digital licenses for games.  felt like the future.  When the series x came out, I decided to give my xbox one S to my kids so they could play their games.  If we try to play at the same time, even though it is not the same game, we aren't allowed.  Okay... surely it will work if I sign in with my Kid's xbox live account that is connected to mine through family controls right?  Nope.  Maybe there is a way to loan the game or transfer the license?  Nope.  Basically I'm SOL, and will be looking for physical used games this holiday season for my kids.  The technology is ready for digital licensing, but MS is not.  I suggest buying physical (preferably used so it hurts their bottom line) until they empower digital owners.The series x itself has been fine.  Crashing a fair amount, but for now I blame that on COD:Cold War

  I'm one of those gamers that buys both Sony and Microsoft systems each go 'round. With the XSX, presentation was everything. From opening up the box and seeing how MS wrapped the XSX, it felt like I bought a premium product. Power up your new system, and you can transfer your existing content over in a flash. I love the SSD, and how quickly everything boots up compared to the previous  One X/S...Seeing NBA 2K21 upgraded is amazing! It's like a totally new game from the One X/S version I was playing. The XSX is whisper quiet..You'll barely notice it's on. Gamepass ultimate is an amazing bargin! My only wish is that MS had some New launch games, but with 2020 being what it is, I understand...I'll still enjoy the games I recently purchased, and the upgraded games like MK11, NBA 2K21, MADDEN 21, COD MW, ORI, AND FORZA HORIZON 4..The future is bright .

  Excellent is the best word to describe this xbox series x. I been a gamer since the 1980s and this is by far the best console ever created. Lets take a look at some pros and cons and also why I think its better then ps5.ProsIts fast! When I say fast I really mean FAST. Loads games in 5 seconds flat, menu system is snappy etc.It's powerful! The few games available to try right now that are optimized for the series x look very good and you can tell the future will bring alot of good high end graphics to consoles finally!Great selection of games thru game pass. And its backwards compatible with all Xbox games from previous consoles.ConsSo far there's only 2.1. I think they could of did better with the controller.  Although I still believe xbox controller is better then the competition in layout and thumb sticks etc. the plastic just feels cheap. The better grip and dpad is nice but the overall feel is cheap. Theres a small lip at the top that gives it a unfinished feeling. Also no rechargeable battery is a bummer as well.. Ps5 controller just looks way better and more of a future look to it.2. The system is bulky and looks like a fridge or just a big black box. The insides alot of work went into to develop a closed system with good cooling and a monster fan which is quiet and I appreciate that but the design is not good.Ps5 design is definitely better.Now why do I feel the series x is better then ps5. It all comes down to a few things.1. It's a bit more powerful2. Better online game library with gamepass.3. Better mobile play options with being able to play straight on your mobile phone or laptop or pc gives the xbox an advantage.If you always been a Playstation guy and all your friends are on there I can see sticking with ps5. But if you don't care about friends and want a bit better experience with ability to play your games even on the go then xbox is the moveI know this is a long review but I feel microsoft deserved it since they did a hell of a job with this system and I highly recommend it to anyone.If your a gamer and thinking of switching from pc to a new console then this would be the one I recommend.

  When I got it games would shut off either immediately or within the hour. I don't know what was wrong, I think it had a faulty power supply. I sent it back; took more than two weeks to get it back with expedited service that I paid an extra $10 for. I received the HDMI and AC power cord a week later in a different box, and I've yet to get the controller back; it's been 4 weeks.I could have purchased a PS5 and I wouldn't have had any of these problems. Stupid mistake.

  ...for Santa to let me buy this. First off, I understand that I got extremely lucky and happened to see a surprise shipment of these that Amazon got the first week of December. I was able to buy it at MSRP and received my series X the next day. And WOW. I love this console. The load times are non existent. I have a low latency 4k TV and the image is amazing! Even early Cyberpunk runs perfect with nearly no load times. I have been gaming since the first NES came out in the 80s and this is the most polished gaming console I've ever experienced. I know others may have issues and the war with PS5 will be brutal... but I am having a blast. So far there isn't a single thing I'd change. X Series and Gamepass is the best gaming value this year.

  I only had this for a few days and so far I love the system. It sits 6 feet away from me and I can not hear it. It is so quiet. I was originally was going to get the Xbox One X in 2018 to replace my Xbox One Launch version but so glad I held off as the XSX is able to run older games nearly at the intended locked framerate with rarely any drops like the Xbox One X. I pulled out some of my old favorite Original Xbox, Xbox 360 and Xbox one games and they all look better with a more stable framerate, a higher resolution with higher amounts of AF.All in all the system is lighting fast. Usually, with load screens, I would pull out my phone or walk away to do something else. With this system, you really cannot do that anymore due to the lightning-fast SSD. The Xbox dashboard is very snappy like modern high-end smartphones. I am very glad I didn't get the Xbox1x and got this. The controller is similar to the Xbox One controllers but it has a textured backside. The triggers also feel more solid.Lastly, I'm not one to do game subscriptions but GamePass is very enticing at $15 per month. I'm planning to sign up by the end of the month.All in all, it's a good value if you have a 4K display. Coming from a Steam PC gamer Im very impressed with the system.

  This console obviously needed further bug testing. After FINALLY getting my day 1 preorder, I was ecstatic. My mood quickly sullied when about a week after purchasing, for some reason the console would be set at 640x480 resolution, with no fix available. The ""solutions"" online do not work, and there's no official word from Microsoft. This is NOT a TV issue. My Xbox One, PS4 and Switch all work perfectly fine. It's just the Series X. It apparently doesn't matter what kind of TV you have, it affects a whole bunch of them. A total headache. You should wait for the Xbox Series XYZ to come out in a year - maybe that one will actually work as advertised. I'm going to try to go about getting a refund.

  The new Series X is absolutely amazing. It's super fast and responsive, makes everything look better on a 4k TV (even non-120Hz tv's), and was SUPER EASY TO SET UP via the Xbox app. Even progressing from the One X, it is very easy to see the difference. It's larger than I expected, but still fits nicely among the atmosphere. The quick resume feature lives up to its name, and I highly recommend it for anybody looking to upgrade their current Xbox experience.For those that were unfortunate enough to get screwed out of launch day pre-order, it is absolutely worth the struggle and frustration.Can't recommend enough! Just don't vape into it.

  I have zero complaints about this console and if you like the Xbox one x then you will absolutely love this Xbox. It is quieter and runs cooler while also being far more powerful. It runs games incredibly smooth so if you are thinking about getting one then I fully recommend it.

  Coming from the Xbox One X I have personally noticed a giant different in smoothness and image quality with Gears 5. I played in awe the entire way through the game on the Series X. It’s a beautiful machine that performs well, and it has surpassed all of my expectations. Assassins Creed Valhalla was the game that really impressed me the most on performance mode. Any worries about no true next gen games went right out the window after playing this game. All games load super fast and it is fantastic. I’m used to loading a game, picking my phone, up and scrolling through social media, etc. With the Series X a game will load so fast that by the time I pick my phone up and open an app that I put it down right away, because I’m in the game already. Each game differs in loading time but boy this machine is fast. Quick Resume works well on older games, and another added bonus. The 4K player plays my movies and they look and sound beautiful as well. It’s also silent to my ears and it lives up to its hype. This was also a preorder and Amazon delivered on launch day and even early in the day as well.

  Shipping and Delivery: My Series X came on launch day as promised. The main box was in a brown padded shipping box. Shout out for that to Amazon. It gives me faith in their shipping process, and with their shipping partner. In my case it was UPS. My personal experience anyways.The Gaming Experience: As for the console, it’s a real monster. It’s like upgrading your PC after 7 years. An instant feeling of power, speed snd graphical output. So yes, you will notice the difference in power, big time, going from the Xbox One to the Series X especially. It’s quick and snappy. The SSD delivers, giving an instant boot up and extremely quick loading times in titles across the generations, whether it’s from 5 years ago or this week. This holds true especially in Series X|S optimized games. I decided to break it in with two games AC: Valhalla and Doom Eternal. It’s as promised. Richer, more dynamic worlds. Fluid frame rates. I couldn’t praise it enough. Ever want to know what a game feels like on a top of the line gaming PC but through the console experience? Series X will deliver on that. I couldn’t be more pleased.The Build: Again, Team Xbox delivered. A solid 14 pounds. So no small console. But it’s top notch in build quality. Heavy, sturdy and striking. I personally believe it’s the finest looking piece of tech in my house. It keeps asking for me to appreciate it as it sits silently in the corner, and each time I turn my head to give it that appreciation. The Series X looks like the premium 500 dollar device it is marked as. Hands down.

  Back in 2013, both Microsoft and Sony launched the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 (respectively). Compared to the generation prior (Xbox 360 and PS3) and how those compared to current PC's of the day, the seventh console generation did not start well. From false promises from Mark Cerny about the PS4 hitting 1080p and 60FPS for every game, to Microsoft's loss of focus on gaming... couple that with the less than impressive comparison to PC's, and you would find the apology for sale a few years later with the PS4 Pro and Xbox One X. Those were what we should have gotten to kick of a generation.Now here we are in 2020. The only downside has been acquiring one of the consoles and the lack of supply due to COVID-19. The Xbox Series X (seriously, Microsoft needs to do something about the naming) is a great offering with great value tucked away inside of the Xbox service.Without getting deep into the technical specs, I will highlight some key differences between the Series X and the One X. The SSD is first. Fast load times across the board for games and the system itself. The 1TB is not what you get in full, but it is not an issue if you keep a small catalogue of installed games. Currently with 6 games installed (AC: Valhalla, Destiny 2 ((all expansions)), GTA V, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Watch Dogs Legion), i am sitting at 357.5GB of free space. The frame rates are great with the ability to keep a steady 60FPS and achieve up to 120FPS. 4K is glorious with HDR. The Ray Tracing that some games have is a really nice touch, but unless you stop to smell the roses (or in this case the, wander up and stare at them), it doesn't jump out at you.Otherwise the console is impressive. Not a single sound has come from the machine in my few hours (extended this evening) of play time. The start up speed is incredibly fast and this is both from a fresh boot, to the low-power mode, to the unplugging method. Quick Resume is something to appreciate as well. Being able to have a handful of games running at once is a nice feature especially if you are one who has game ADD, or want to hop back into a single-player game after having a multiplayer session with friends.The new controller is built on the old saying, ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it."" While Sony went with a new design and functionality for the PS5 with the DuelSense controller (seriously the haptic feedback is a cool addition, but I have a weird feeling it will fade out at some point), I can't help but feel Microsoft kinda missed a chance with the Series X controller, by not adding a similar feature. However, the controller feels lighter than the last, that could be due to the fact I am using batteries instead of a play and charge kit. It feels also, slightly slimmer all around, but the shape is still ergonomically pleasing for any hand to hold. I don't mind the absence of an internal battery pack. I find that the play and charge is a nice option, and that with batteries you never have to worry about being plugged in. The jump to USB type C is nice as well, as most of the devices I own use that port exclusively. Added on to the controller's body is a texture around the back of the hand grips and the tops of the triggers. My grip feels more stable and connected. Also, the addition of a share button is nice for two reasons. First it is a great way to capture what you want without sacrificing gameplay or being vulnerable in a multiplayer title. And 2, it allows for screenshots to now be captured that when being taken by hitting the Guide button, would sometimes cause elements to disappear.As for the value tucked away that I mentioned, that comes thanks to Game Pass. A service I was not fully sold on when it was announced, but as time went on, I became interested and am now a member. And now with them (Microsoft) partnering with EA to bring EA Access to game pass, it makes me wonder what the future holds.

  I noticed the two reviews for this console are people that were upset that they didn't get one. Hopefully Amazon will remove these. I have purchased the Series X, and am very happy with what I got. The loading times are great, the games look and play great, and the console is super quiet. If you have Game Pass, you can't go wrong with this purchase, and if you don't, you should get Game Pass. It really is a great console, and I can't wait to see what games will be coming out for it in the future.

  It is an amazing console... I find it ridiculous how some of the negative reviews are based on no exclusives at launch. Like didn't they know that before pre ordering?The fact that I still haven't played many titles due to my busy life, there are so may games I can play off the bat on day one with this console. The fact that every game I played on the Series X runs so fast with loading time, and higher and steadier frame rates impresses me. Definitely a great upgrade from my Xbox One X to the Series X.I was able to simply use the 2 hard drives I had on the One X to the Series X with no problem, but if I want to play a game where I would want the Series X to take advantage of speed and performance, I would have it in the Series X's Internal drive, or in the SSD Seagate 1TB that goes behind the console.$500 for what it includes on the specs alone is a heck of a deal.5/5 No doubt. Xbox and Microsoft did an amazing job witwith this console in every way.

  This is above and beyond the best Xbox console to date, however there are system updates still needed to improve the overall performance in games. Due to the fact that Microsoft waited for AMD to finalize the RDNA 2 feature set so the Series consoles could have the entire feature set, the system is behind in terms of max performance capabilities. Once these system updates roll out and the system fully utilizes the full RDNA 2 feature set and games are taking full advantage of them, we should see the full potential of the console. Early on there seems to be some slight performance issues with the cross gen titles at least. Still very happy with Xbox and the direction it's going as a gaming platform.

  Xbox Series X is everything I hope and dreamed it would be! The first game I played on it was Assassin's Creed:Valhalla! It looks absolutely amazing! 4k resolution at 60 frames per second! Load times are extremely quick thanks to the custom SSD Harddrive. The new Controller is pretty awesome too. It has new grips on the back of the controller and also on the triggers. There is also a new share button on it that allows you to take screenshots of the games you are playing. If you hold the button down it records a game clip. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate is really awesome with Xbox Series X. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate now includes EA play at no additional cost. EA Play contains over 70 games. I highly recommend getting an Xbox Series X if you want to experience true next gen gaming!

  Have had it for 2 weeks now. Gotta say that it's a pretty cool console. If you have an XONE or OneX you'll feel familiar with the ui since it's basically the same. Now there aren't that many games that scream Next gen yet. Though the upgrades for series x/s optimized games are very cool with more incoming. As it stands, besides things like quick resume(which has it's few issues like not working 100% of the time), faster loading times, this gen is barely starting. So don't fret if you haven't been able to get one yet. Another point with these new consoles (ps5 included) is that in order to play at 4k 120 frames per second you need a tv that has hdmi 2.1. I went with an LG un 65nano85una. Awesome tv and not as pricey as oleds.

   Absolutely love this console and I gotta say I'm lucky to have been able to pre order and have it arrive on time. One of the game changing feature for me is the quick resume. With this you can have multiple games running and going back into them right where you left off(without having to load into the game again). Also gamepass is a no brainer especially since games are bumping up in price to $70. With gamepass, all Microsoft exclusives are FREE! You also have a vast selection of games including ea play. Lastly, the graphics and speed of this console are amazing. I'm currently playing ac Valhalla and load times are just a bit behind that of ghost of tsushima but with even better visuals. Also the simplicity of the ui and controller are the things I love most about xbox. All in all I'm more than glad I purchased this console!

  So, yeah, new generation of hardware from Microsoft but can I talk about that box?  Because that was a spectacular way to jump into the next Xbox.You open the box up and there is the Series X all wrapped up like it's in a treasure chest.  It was great!  I actually had to take some video of it because it was above and beyond what I expected from unboxing a new console.  So good job on that!I'm upgrading from an Xbox One S and from that perspective, it was definitely time to upgrade.  I've got this 4K TV without a system that properly utilizes it!  I held off on getting a One X because I knew the next Xbox system would be coming out soon enough.And here it is.Visually speaking, I'm not really noticing TOO much difference from games on the One S.  There are some added details on some of my old games to upgrade them to 4K and I notice some effects that weren't there before.  Everything is less fuzzy.  So that's good.  It's just not the same as the visual jump from the NES to the SNES.  Or the Playstation to the Playstation 2.  But it IS close to the leap from the Xbox 360 to the Xbox One.  The difference there was only noticeable a few years after the fact for me.  I imagine the same will be true here, especially since most of the games I'm playing right not are Xbox One games upgraded to 4K and not native Series X games, beyond Yakuza: Like a Dragon.And that details the biggest drawback to getting a Series X at launch: lack of a strong exclusive library of games.  While the Playstation 5 has Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Godfall, and Sackboy, there isn't anything on the Xbox that can't be played on the PS5 except Yakuza: Like a Dragon (and that can probably be played as a PlayStation 4 game through backwards compatibility).  With Halo Infinite being delayed, there's no massive reason to upgrade your hardware.Well... I SAY that but I also don't regret doing so.  I'm disappointed in the lack of exclusives but the 4K is still very nice.  And it isn't even the best part of the Series X.  That would be the load times.  With the new hardware and the new memory storage system, games load incredibly fast.  I used to start a game up and then head into the kitchen to grab a drink or whatever while the console booted things up but those days are done.  This thing zips along.  That also applies while you're in the game.  Reloads and fast travels, even cut-scenes, happen swiftly.  There's a lot of power in this rectangular box.  The Playstation 5 also has super fast load times so it's not a selling feature if you're comparing consoles but, on its own, it presents a compelling case.It's a lot of the ""under-the-hood"" features that build this system up as a good replacement for your Xbox One.  The fact that it is capable of playing a large number of Xbox's back catalog going all the way back to the original Xbox means you'll have a huge library of games to play even if they aren't brand new exclusives.  I've got a serious backlog of titles so playing them in 4K and getting into my games faster is fine for me right now.  If you are a Gamepass subscriber, you have a large library of games to choose from right out of the gate, including a lot of EA games added from their EA Play subscription service.  I spent my first day just downloading everything I'm going to be wasting my time on over the next few months.And, let me be clear: if you play on Xbox, do yourself a favor and subscribe to Gamepass.  You get some great games and many of them are upgraded to take advantage of the Series X.  It's a good deal.I'm happy with my purchase.  I wish Halo would have made launch.  I'm also happy they held it back so that when it releases, it's worth playing.  But, man, launch would have made this purchase a lot more palatable.  In the end, it comes down to where your friends are.  Mine are on Xbox so here I am.  This thing is a powerhouse and I doubt I'm going to regret having it a year or so down the line.But if you have to make a choice between this and the Playstation 5 and you don't really do online gaming with your friends, the Playstation 5 makes a more compelling case this holiday season.  Miles Morales looks really good.But if Sony's exclusives don't move you, the third party games are all multiplatform.  You can enjoy your Call of Dutys and your Assassin's Creeds on whatever console you manage to get.  In 2020, I think we could all use a win and I think there's enough to keep you busy on both consoles to check that win box.Oh! This thing also has a controller!  It is pretty much exactly like the Xbox One controller which was a slight upgrade from the 360 controller... which was an upgrade from the Xbox S controller.  This is my favorite controller layout and it feels as comfortable in my hands as the XB1 version.  There's a capture button now to take pictures and video which is something Sony added with the PlayStation 4 and Nintendo added on the Switch.  So Microsoft is a little behind but it's here now!  I have not used it yet but I'm sure I'll get around to it.Anyway, welcome to the next generation of video game hardware.  This thing is a beast of tech and should prove a worthwhile purchase. In time.  Day one, you know what you're getting: an I.O.U. note promising better things to come.But, man, that treasure box opening is pretty great. ;)

  As soon as I opened the package I was in awe with how beautifully it was packaged, it’s super solid and sturdy. Plugging it in was very easy, no more power bricks, just one cord straight from the Xbox to the wall. Turned it on and it was like magic. Instantly started downloading games, and they look stunning! I have played Forza Horizon 4, Fallout 4, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, and Dirt 4, and each load super quick. Huge leap from the load times of the Xbox one. In fallout 4, I can fast travel and have it loaded to the next place in about 5 seconds. Graphics of optimized games such as Forza look so much better than I expected. Everything is super fast, next to no wait times, and runs super smoothly. Quick resume works very well, loads back into the game within 10 seconds right where I left off. Controller feels very good in my hands, textured triggers are amazing. Super simple setup, gorgeous graphics, very short load times, very very smooth gameplay. All in all, was 1000x better than expected. Couldn’t be happier. I use a 27” 4K monitor.

  Really great product, a few bugs when getting started (logging in and setting up the console account) but, those will be ironed out with a software update. Make sure to use a 4K tv with at least 60hz if you want the most out of the experience.

  I know most people will say there is no reason to upgrade at this time due to no exclusive content, but the loading times alone were worth it.  Borderlands 3 loading times are like 4 times faster.  Game loads in around 1 minute compared to 5 and fast travels are around 13 seconds compared to 1 minute.  Think of how much time people wasted farming on the Xbox One due to those horrendous loading times.  As they say ""Time is Money"" and this system will definitely save you time so you can do other things instead of wasting it on loading screens.

  I bought this console for the next gens games but every time I try to play a next gen game my console turns off after 30 mins of playing. This only happens to next gen games. I paid good money for this Console and I expected great things, come on Microsoft smh. The game runs smoothly before the console turns off. Everything else works really good no overheating or anything.

  Great Xbox and a seemingly good upgrade from the Xbox One. Build quality seems nice and durable. The footprint of the device is much different than the older versions, to be standing vertically instead of horizontally.Load times are blazing fast. I've been playing Gears Tactics on game pass lately and the load times are dropped by more than half. Don't know if I've tapped into the usefulness of my HDMI 2.1 TV but games look excellent on my Sony X90CH 65"" TV.Overall a worthy upgrade from the previous gen. I'm pretty excited to see how long this device will last me

  I've never been so blown away by a console before, this system truly delivers on what Microsoft promised. Although there aren't many games that can truly take advantage of the hardware performance the series x offers, the games that are x/s enhanced are otherworldly. Silky smooth 4k HDR at 120fps is gorgeous and I'll never go back. And it's soooooo quiet! Quick resume and transfer speeds from/to the seagate drive are a game changer. I transferred 100 Gb in 3 minutes. Crazy! I'm so happy with this console and can't wait for the next generation of gaming!

  Exclusives aren’t there yet but the game pass ultimate subscription is a great value as had different games to try out.  Loading is a lot quicker too.My only complaint would be the guide is exactly the same and the controller feels identical which sucks as it doesn’t feel like a next gen but a refresh.  Wish they would have revamped both like sony did

  I am a PC gamer but when the Series X was announced I was going to pre-order.Console is great, well made and looks cool.Gameplay is honestly amazing at 4K. Some games run just as well if not better than my gaming rig PC, and I have a pretty solid PC.The controller is great and improved over an already really good controller design. The reach is much further than the gen 2 Xbox one controllers and the share button is great.I highly recommend this system to anyone. Having Gamepass ultimate with EA games included is an unreal value.

  Xbox series x is the real deal. Fast load times. 60 frames per second on games like assassin's creed valhalla. The new controller is really nice, a bigger improvement than people think. Tons of games to play on gamepass. Setting it up is seamless. The series x console runs whisper quiet. Next generation is here and xbox is better than ever.

  Xbox has finally perfected building a great console now it needs to work on getting some games out for that great console. If you have an xbox one x I would highly recommend waiting until they start releasing more games as there just isnt enough to play for next gen games that justify paying $500+. No complaints with the hardware though.

  Got this as a gift for myself.  Jumped on the pre order when it was first offered.  Love it so far.Awesome piece of tech.  Fantastic looking game system.  Comes packaged in a luxurious box.  The unboxing was amazing.So far the system runs fantastic.  Its so silent, you can't tell its on.  I've played a ton of older games and the backwards compatibility is second to none.  I've also played a few new games and they look and run very solid.Now we just need more games!

  Exceptional hardware. Loading times and smoother gameplay/graphics are the winners here. Same UI you're used to and snappy menus. Quick Resume is a great and old games look better than before. Game pass is the killer app so far. If microsoft can bring the exclusives in 2021, it's a home run for Xbox.

  First off I’d like to say the console has been awesome since I’ve received it. I ordered to receive day one but did end up receiving 3 days afterwards which was fine with me... kinda. Installing the system to my setup was easy. Very smooth and great graphics. Definetly excited for the long haul.Few bad things I’ve noticed with Bluetooth issues with my headset and controller. They will only reconnect with I hard reset the console, a slight burning plastic smell but that’s been slowly going away, only bad things I noticed really lol

  The xbox series x works great, but has a few bugs. For example, sometimes the xbox simply refuse to turn off unless you take out the batteries from the controller, because it keep turning the console back on automatically. I might have a ghost or something though so that might be it.

  I liked that this came on time, unlike another order I had from Amazon. It was an early Christmas gift for a friend and he honestly loved it, the resolution is really high and you can tell there was a nice amount of work done and considering I have the Xbox one s, I can especially tell the difference. However, I do not like the shape nor the price, for a 560 price tag you would expect something extra like a second controller or, who knows a headset or something, but nothing. The packaging was kinda nifty tho where it wasn’t a traditional Xbox box. I also did not like the way it was super vertical so I can’t really find a good spot to fit it now without blocking the screen or put it on the floor and hope no one topples it’s over :/

  Quality is the best! Is the most powerful next gen console currently out right now! I don’t like how the used the same old last gen display interface but that’s okay, I have the ps5 as well and the quality on the Xbox is a lot better! Especially when u play call of duty warzone online, huge difference in input lag because the Xbox provides a easier backward compatibility updater  because of its design. The Ps5 on the other hand struggles with updating backward compatibile games. They either have input lags or are chopping at times. Xbox truly shows it’s power! 5 out of 5

  Very fast loading times, excellent graphics, no software bugs that I can tell, which along with the fantastic value of Gamepass Ultimate is what sets it apart from the PS5 for me. The PS5 crashes sometimes and the new PS5 menu isn't as good as the old one. In contrast, the Xbox menu is unchanged overall and just works well. It's auto-resume feature is fantastic. It is also completely silent. I put decals on mine to give the black brick a little personality.

  I was supposed to get this on launch day but for some reason it stayed around in Georgia for 24 hours. I got it on the 11 and I noticed that a screw was loose. Not a little screw either but a big one. Doesn't even seem like the kind of screw that would even be used in the console. I wedged it into a corner because I didn't have any tools on me that could pull it out and then I tried the system out to see if it would run. I had it running for over 7 hours with no issues.  I have something that can pull the screw out at work and I will bring that to home with me to remove the screw. I saw a few reports of the screws falling out of other people's series x but the screws I've seen don't look like the one I have. Just wanted to mention this incase Microsoft, Amazon, or a potential customer is looking at reviews. I'm going to keep the system but if it dies on me after the return window closes I will forever curse the name Microsoft and the year 2020.

  Let me tell you the graphics, colors and FPS is greatly noticeable. I came from a PS4 and could not get a PS5. Anyone who writes a review that says it is not a huge jump must be a fanboy for PS or has a high end PC. This console is amazing at playing backwards compatible games and the FPS is highly noticeable. Every game looks stunning in 4k and the colors pop out more than before. If you have an Xbox one you will love this console. If you are like me you may need to buy new games in a different environment. Do not hate on any console, only buy what you want and not the opposite of what is being hated on.

  I lucked out and saw an article on the web that Amazon had a limited number of Xbox x Series. I went to Amazon and wow, it was still not sold out. It did about an hour later when I checked. So I lucked out. But the machine is amazing. That is not hyperbole. Borderlands 3 took close to 4-5 minutes opening on my Xbox One X. This machine takes about 10 seconds! from opening the game to playing. The games themselves run as smooth as butter no lag and stuttering on multiplayer games. Love it.

  It's an amazing piece of hardware that is going to have some amazing games on it in the next couple of years. Halo Infinite's delay definitely hurts the launch lineup but this console will have so many reasons to lay on it in 1-2 years time. Halo Infinite is 343's Halo 3.

  After preordering and getting the email that I would not come until Dec 31st, I panicked and looked for restocks everywhere. I then received a notification the next day that it shipped and low and behold it was here a few days later. No complaints, great system!

  The Xbox Series X is a very fast console and great upgrade from my previous Xbox One (day one console). If you’re looking to get the same experience from last Gen but upgraded, this console is definitely a huge upgrade. You can still talk to people from other Xbox One consoles.You’re paying for the quick resume feature, extremely fast load times, & the 144 hz and 4K experience. (Not every game can run at 144z and 4K yet)

  Having owned all but one Xbox generation on release day, I can honestly say that the Series X feels far more finished than the 360 or One did at launch. Everything works as intended. The UI, although not shiny and new, works flawlessly. The graphics are awesome, it’s quiet, it runs cooler than its predecessor, and load times are a fraction of what they used to me. I might be in love with a gaming console.

  Fortunate for me I have both the playstation 5 and the xbox, and I can say I prefer the xbox over the playstation. Although both systems are similar, the xbox is faster. Downloads and load time are crazy, and when the controller turns on it turns on quickly as well. The graphics are amazing as well. I cant wait until more games come out so we can see what xbox can really do.

  This console is absolutely amazing. The lid first thing you notice when you boot it up are the smooth, crisp, and fast load times. The graphics are  on par with a high end PC in the optimized games. The console itself is beautiful. It is very modernistic and blends in well with it’s environment. I have not encountered any errors with it yet!

  Thrilled to own the Series X. Despite the lack of a diverse set of launch titles, I truly appreciate the time Microsoft took on this console. Feels like a PC due to being paired with a new LG OLED TV. High frames @ 120Hz without sacrificing picture quality.

  
"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"









  
  
    
  Compared to the One X, this is a great upgrade. Some games that had slow downs (such as COD MW) are completely smooth on here. I also really like the controller, because, even compared to the Elite Series 2, the thumbsticks are better. I also like the expansion port over what the PS5 has, which is a much simpler card solution when compared to the M.2 SSD slot on the PS5 (which isn't even active at launch).

  The console is good, but it doesn't feel like a next gen console. The only difference is that I can notice that I am loading into games faster. Unfortunately, some games will freeze forcing me to exit out or restart the console, this could be a game issue and not a console issue. Overall, the system is good, but there is no need to rush until better optimized games are ready.

  First off I just want to say that I love everything about this console. The controller, the load times, the graphics, the UI, everything. My main issue is that, Microsoft offers a lot of games in Games with Gold and Game Pass and the issue im having is that I dont have enough storage for the games that I want. I wish there were 2T versions, but I will deal with it until I can scrap together another $100 for a 4T Seagate.

  My nephew Anthony who came to live with me in  2020 never had much let alone a modern game system. All year long talked about wanting the new Xbox. He saved up he collected cans from the neighbors all year and then when it was time to go buy one NOPE. All the bad men as he called them made it so a  13 yr old boy who worked his but off couldn't make his dream happen.For those who don't know we have some people who wrote software and they use it too buy up every console they can. Amazon and Walmart and game stop could put protections in place to stop mass buying but why they make their money and in the case of Amazon they make more when that item is bought then marked up.This kid is seriously devastated he at 13 cant understand why he saved all year and cant own a new game system.

  Look bottom line is if you already have an Xbox One X,,,wait. Save your money keep it in your pocket use that money to buy games but you can still play on X1X.. right now you're not going to get any better graphics the best you might get is some frame rates and some load times. If that's really worth another $500 or more plus all the hassle of stock to you then I feel kind of sorry for you. By the time games are actual next-gen capable within a year to two years after that a mid gen console that's more powerful come out.. day one edition consoles are for the beta testers. Then the Alphas come in and get the better deals the better product with the better content.. same with the PlayStation. Since I only use PlayStation for exclusives there's no reason for me to get one for at least a year...

  Amazing.  I held out on the One X because there had been whispers of this next gen console for several years, so I figured I would just go all in whenever it came out.  I was one of the fortunate few who were able to snag a pre order, and I have been playing daily since launch.  The performance is unbelievable.  There obviously isn't much in the way of Series X games yet, but I have been catching up on some Xbox One games I haven't played, notably Doom Eternal and Control so far.  If those are considered last gen games running on the Series X, I can't imagine how games could look or perform much better.  They look incredibly great, and load times are basically non-existent.  It's just a joy playing.Packaging and set up really feel top notch.  They went over the top with the packaging, it feels really nice opening.  Set up is very easy too, similar to setting up a google product.  You do it all through your phone, and it is very easy and painless.  I was worried when there were reports of it ""running hot like a furnace"" pre launch, but those reports are pretty laughable.  It doesn't get any hotter than any other console I've had, and it actually probably runs much cooler than my old OG Xbox 360 that bit the dust a while back.  The great thing that you wont notice as well, is that it is super quiet.  The only time I hear it is when its whirring whenever I power it on.The only minor negatives I have are that it is big, and IMO a little ugly.  However it is smaller and I think better looking than the PS5.  I have it set up horizontally on my entertainment center, and it doesn't look quite right.  Its obviously made to be set up vertically, but I don't know anyone who puts their consoles in a vertical position, and not to mention you can't really put it in an entertainment center that way.  But when you're playing, who cares how it looks?  The other thing is that quick resume is finicky.  It doesn't work ALL the time, but when it does it's amazing.  You can literally power on the console, and you're playing exactly where you left off last time in about 30 seconds.  I also wish there were an SPDIF out for my AV receiver.If you're a gamer and deciding between the Series X or the Series S, I think in the long run the Series X is absolutely a better bet.  The main thing that scared me off on the Series S is the memory, and the lack of a disc drive.  The cost of the expandable storage is exorbitantly expensive, and the 500GB will probably fill up fast on the Series S.  If you buy the S and the proprietary storage, you're already at the cost of the Series X.  However the 1 TB on the Series X is perfect.  I currently have 13 games, between One and 360 versions, with about 50% storage remaining.  However, I'm sure future games will take some more space.  Overall, I am overly happy with this, and has made my quarantine time actually enjoyable.  Just do not buy from resellers on ebay, as I am sure more are coming available very soon.

  Having both a PS5 and an Xbox Series X -- I can safely say the PS5 is the real next-gen experience.Both have great base hardware, but the PS5 makes a real leap into the next generation with the groundbreaking DualSense controller, amazing 3D Audio, and a whole new UI -- While Xbox Series X is just a hardware boost to the pre-existing Xbox One. What a disappointment.And that's to say nothing of the massive games deficit between the two, which will only keep growing -- Sony has many of the world's finest studios churning out unparalleled experiences.I just can't find a reason to turn on my Xbox Series X at all right now. I imagine I'll find some reason eventually, but I have a strong feeling it's never going to justify the $500 price tag -- nor even a $300 one.I know the PS5 is hard to find right now, but keep trying. It's worth it.

  The difference in game quality both graphically and responsiveness was night and day from my Xbox One. The console powers on and delivers me to the hone screen in less than 2 seconds, and boots games in a similar timeframe.One major issue Microsoft needs to address, but probably won't, is the fact that many gaming monitors aren't compatible with the xbox at 1440p 120hz. These monitors can run these specs over hdmi 2.0, but don't conform to the standard VESA timings, which is all Microsoft uses. This limits many high end gaming monitors to 1080p 120hz, or 1440p 60hz, which is unfortunate. If you plan to upgrade your tv or monitor, make sure you do considerable research into which model will actually work like it should with the Series X.

  My honest non biased critique on the xsx DiscussionHonestly this system has been very disappointing for me. I have been a gamer all of my life, and never been a fanboy of the big 3. I game to game, and mainly get all 3 systems each gen. This isn't for the people who can't counter my points in a constructive way, and will just lazily label me a troll or some garbage. I currently have every Microsoft system hooked up, minus my og xbox which is put away. I only bought it because I still wanted to play true crime nyc, mech assault, and Def Jam fight for NY. I am upgrading from an xbox one slim to the series x.Onto the critiques:The network adapter is worse than the xbox one slim one. I have tested this mutliple times. I have downloaded a game on my one slim and a game update(Haven 1.66gb) on the xsx, the one slim downloaded quicker.Also it random disconnects for no reason. Since I got my xsx on 12/15 I have ran the system by itself and no other system, and I have run it along with my slim(I have to do something else with all these huge updates and upgrades going on). Due to it randomly disconnecting, it would cause freezing and system issues. I go to play said games, long system freezes and crashes. Disconnect, then immediately reconnect and then retry to play the said game. Then be told of a huge update file 3 times back to back(glitching due to disconnection), then it finally starts updating and upgrading finally.The huge update and upgrades. OH MY GOD!!!!!!! I swear this was the first thing to almost make me ragequit all future Microsoft consoles, and to sell my xsx for a ps5. I copied over some games from my external hdd. Think I would just get a upgrade to xsx version and be done with it? Nope!!!!!! You have to update huge files , only to be told you need to upgrade with 55gb+ sized files(Destiny 2 upgrade was 70gbs) on top of that. I don't feel like I bought a game system but a non stop updating and upgrading system. Boy do I feel for the people with data caps and restrictions.External Harddrive issues. I am using a wd 4tb passport extrnal drive on my one slim & xsx, pretty good brand. I bought it a year ago. I have 415 games on it digitally when I plug it into my one slim, however when I plug it into my xsx I have 385 digitally on it. What happened to those other 30 games? I have restarted both systems and then tried the external harddrive on both multiple times. I am at a lost.Downloading is really bad. When I initially saw the slower speeds and longer download times, I took to google and discovered via youtube you can't have games opened while downloading or otherwise you get slower speeds. On my one slim, I could download a game, watch youtube, and run rewards or gamepass and still get good speeds. On the xsx, that isn't happening unless you want your downloads to crawl to a snail's pace. I don't see how this is next gen, and previous gen could do better. This basically nullifies any value quick resume has.Auto Hdr. Why not make it to where you can turn off the auto hdr in each game individually? Why must it be either off or on? Some games can look good with auto hdr, while others like scarygirl looks weird with auto hdr. I am forced to cut it off and not enjoy the games that will benefit from it, or leave it on and play great games that visually look bad or weird due to auto hdr. No middle ground or compromise.Visual difference. Having upgraded from an one slim & nice 4k uhd tv, I barely see any real difference visually. From 4k blu ray movies to games, I see no real difference. I was expecting to be blown away since I was constantly told native 4k was so much better than upscaled 4k. I have tested out movies and games on the xsx, nothing has made me say yes this is worth owning a $540 system over lol.In Closing: Even at the moment of writing this, I am using my one slim to do youtube while my xsx updates and upgrades(66.13gb for forza horizon 4) to avoid slow down. I paid $250-$275 out of pocket(the rest in rewards points) for this system and I am severely disappointed by it. My one slim can do almost everything the xsx can do, if not some things better. I am not impressed. I wish I had waited 2 years.

  The xbox itself is great but the amount of people who are re-selling it for 1000+ dollars makes it very difficult to find a standard product.

  To start off with I see a lot of post that say this is a scam etc. To clear the air. There are people that can resell through amazon just be weary of who you're purchasing from. I purchased this directly from Microsoft throguh amazon at 599$ CAD. I did also have to purchase a tv for the full experience samsung Q70 hdmi 4 supports 2.1 hdmi and 4k. The Q80 &Q90 do support this also if you were wondering.The xbox does give calibration options for your TV.The walk through at the beginning is really key for the experience.Yes we were short handed because xbox delayed all their new game releases but system functionality wise SO FAR is great. I will Update this once I've played some games just to advise of my full experience.

  Incredible machine. Sets up in a flash. The App is key for easy set up. Feels so smooth. HDR is incredible for upscaling games. Nice to have 800gb and purchasable expandable memory now.Obvious drawback are games. We need more. BUT the upscaling with game pass and HDR allows you to rediscover old games which is awesome.Playing the Xbox Series X with the Elite 2 controller and Arctis SteelSeries 9X is a transcendent experience. Truly the Ferrari of gaming.And it’s not THAT big compared to a Day 1 Xbox One.

  The Xbox Series X addresses the Xbox One X's weakest point: speed. It has a powerful CPU in addition to its monstrous GPU and has built-in SSD. You'll be impressed with the speed from the get-go. The initial setup was super fast and it even allows you to copy settings from the cloud that it backed up from your previous console.You'll be up and running in no time, and if you are a Gamepass subscriber, you'll have great games to play such as Gears Tactics & Tetris Connected. You'll have to be patient though as they download or as you apply the Series X optimization patches. While the delay of Halo Infinite's launch left a big hole in the launch lineup, it did not really bother me as I have more than enough launch games to play. Yakuza Like a Dragon is quite fun and looks fantastic on the console. Tetris Connected, while not a graphical showcase, manages to look quite cool and flashy, and  is incredibly addicting with numerous online and solo game modes.The backwards compatibility truly shines and it is a joy going back to some of your favorite titles that perform better now with the power of the Series X. Forza Horizon 4 and Gears 5 never looked so good at 4K-60fps. The new controller is not a big change, but since I use the Elite 2 anyways, that didn't bother me all too much. I quite like how the new controller feels and it seems they made some minor yet meaningful tweaks to it overall. The bumpers seem more responsive to me and the share button is a useful addition.Looking forward to seeing what's next for this powerful console and I am very impressed with the overall package so far.  Cheers

  Purchased straight from Amazon on release day. Was surprised to see that they had the Xbox in stock (had no intention of buying on release day due to my limited luck in these things). Pretty happy with my purchase.So far I've installed Call of Duty Cold War and the game looks really great on my 4K TV. I upgraded directly from the regular Xbox One 500gb so there's an enormous difference between that and the Series X. The Series X boots up instantly, there's practically no wait times for any loading screens, and best of all there is no lag for once. You could feel how outdated my regular Xbox One became.Yes there is basically no games out for the system right now. Yes the PS5 is cooler because they redesigned the controller and have some decent games out right now. That being said, I purchased this Xbox for Halo so I'm just waiting for that. Is the console worth $599? Depends if you're okay with spending the money. Otherwise just wait it out with your Xbox One X or PS4 Pro for now. Don't pay scalper money please (it's not worth like 1 grand lol)

  The Xbox series X is the gold standard for gaming.It loads games in seconds and boots up super fast. Playing a 4K is beautiful as long as you have the appropriate TV or display. And your media apps are all available to view and work as expected.The system is packaged very well from Microsoft and it is a pleasure to open and wield protected. Out of the box it comes with everything you need.Setup is easy and fast with the Xbox app for smart phones. You will be up and running in a few short minutes.The system runs cool and Quiet! It is a huge improvement from last generation. You will need to make sure your entertainment unit has enough room for proper airflow or place it beside or behind your TV.The only con so far is the power cable is a little on the short side but definitely not to small but a longer cable could add flexibility for placement considering it’s size.

  True 4K Gaming Experience!Played COD Warzone at 120fps and it amazed me how powerful the console is.  The size of the XSX is also perfect. The huge fan is extremely quiet. I can barely hear anything even it is working at 100% loading. The only thing I don’t feel as good as my PlayStation 5 is the controller. The DualSense of PS5 brings the next gen gaming to a whole new level. Really really hope Microsoft will update the controller soon! Right now I will buy And play a cross platform game on PS5 if the game is using dualsense until XSX gets a real next gen controller.

  Firstly, if you are unable to get your hands on a Series X, be patient and keep checking the online stock. When I got this system I was impressed by the small size and the overall design that keeps everything subtle and cool, looks are going to be subjective but I like the way the Series X looks. After upgrading from an Xbox One, I am thankful for a simple power cord and no brick, the included HDMI 2.1 cable, and the new controller is like the old one so usability is great.The SSD is obviously an issue and expanding the space with the proprietary expansion is quite expensive at the moment, luckily the Series X recognized my old 4TB hard drive with Xbox One games, and it was really easy from then on to manage my games. I have Series X/S enhanced titles on the internal SSD while everything else is playable from the external hard drive.The issue I have is that there are no real titles here that can sell this console, missing is the one or two console release games that really show off what this system can do and that's why ""next-gen"" isn't quite here yet. If you're planning on getting a Series X or S anyway, I highly recommend Xbox Gamepass because it has a lot of games and titles like Forza Horizon 4 that are enhanced for the Series X/S and look and play amazingly well.

  If you’ve owned any Xbox One since 2013, using this Xbox doesn’t require any new learning of a new OS, which some might find as an annoyance since we are used to brand new OS’s with the launch of a new console. Plugging in an external HDD from my last Xbox One comes with the immediate access to all my previously installed games, which makes using the console immediately, much easier. Using Xbox Series X enhanced patches requires that you either copy or re-install the game to the internal SSD or Seagate Expansion SSD (which I don’t have). I was a bit disappointed to see that game installing is still dramatically slower than my PC with similarly equipped specs, but it is still an upgrade over the Xbox One models. Playing Xbox Series X enhanced games with an HDR display look awesome. They are remarkably sharp and the colours look vivid with performance I could only previously achieve on my significantly more expensive custom built PC. For the retail price of $599 Canadian, I can say that as a PC Gamer, this console is well worth the price, especially when paired with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate (which I was surprised to see no code in the box for).

  I was really looking forward to the series X, and was excited when I managed to get one in a Wal-Mart drop.  So far it has been nothing but frustration.  There is no optical port, which is bad since my receiver doesn't take HDMI.  The worst part is it won't connect wired.  My Xbox One and TV are the only things in my house I don't do wireless, and I would strongly prefer the series X be wired as well.  Support has been absolutely no help whatsoever.

  I received my Xbox Series X direct from Microsoft on launch day.  Two observations, it's incredibly faster than my Xbox One X and extremely quiet considering how big the cooling fan is.  The game quick start feature is similar to unpausing the game but doing it when the console is off.  One concern I did have, is that when the console is on it's side it get's incredibly hot.  Nothing happened but I moved it vertical to be proactive.

  feels like x1 x nothing new use same interface so its like still on x1 and games well its xbox they have no exclusives so basic 3rd party stuff all games can play on ps5 or pc , system resume feature is amazing and best new thing to gaming .  but if you want play games cheap they have gamepass ultimate . the extra memory is stupid its $350 Canadian after tax for 1 tb memory  and system only comes with 800 gigs usable space , so you will be deleting and re installing a lot when games like cod are 180 gigs .  bottom line i would wait for price drop since halo never released so all games are old x1 stuff or 3rd party.  plus so stupid no Bluetooth and speeds to dl are not great not sure part used for internet card but compared to ps5 its slow as hell downloading and install from disk .  controller is same nothing new but dpad style and still only company uses batteries wants us pay more for there charger something sony and Nintendo built in to there amazing controllers

  Coming from an orginal 2013 Xbox One the Series X is an amazing upgrade.Games load in seconds, quick resume is a great feature allowing me to game surf like never before. 1 TB of space is a huge amount I currently have 15 games loaded the majority AAA.This has been the most affordable generation change ever, I didn't have to buy a 2nd controller as all my Xbox one devices are compatable. Gamepass is such a huge value allowing me to play brand new games like Gears Tactics and Tetris Connected and load up Series X upgraded games like Gears 5, Sea of Thieves, and Forza Horizon 4. I haven't had to spend anything on games and can wait until some of the launch lineup goes on sale.Playing game in 4k and especially 60 FPS is so nice. I feel so grateful to be one of the lucky ones to get this at launch. Thank you Amazon Canada for the flawless purchase and shipping. This has not been the case with a lot of retailers including your American counterpart. I'm so grateful.

  The ability to switch between games quickly is wonderful. Knowing MS they will keep tweaking and updating the UI over time. The loading times are so much better, even for older games. I used to wait over 30 seconds every time I fast travelled somewhere, and now it’s like 5 seconds or less.For most people the Series S will be fine, but if you sit close to your TV or really need that 4K resolution, then this is the way to go. Considering Series X has more storage, and the storage sticks are expensive, it’s better to pay more upfront now for the space AND get a better console. I think games will only increase in size, and being able to hold 5-10 compared to 10-20 is a big difference.

  I had a real hard to securing an xbox series x, but thankfully I found it in stock on amazon! It was shipped quickly and I received it in a few days! Very happy with amazon's service and speediness.  The xbox is awesome, playing games in 4k 60fps is something I wanted since seeing it first hand. The difference between 30fps to 60fps is amazing and makes everything so much smoother. I can't wait to try out 120fps once I get a game that supports it!  No idea what that will be like!  The xbox is quiet, does not overheat and is a dream to play. This next gen upgrade is amazing! Can't wait to try out cyberpunk 2077 when it comes out next week!

  Although an upgrade to a PS4 and XBONE are not completely necessary at this time, this console is  amazing. Since I have my One X, in the living room, and the Series X in the game room, I get to see the difference in visual quality and performance of games first hand.  I considered the PS5 but I hardly used my Ps4 and most of the games form last generation were purchased on the Xbox ecosystem so this made alot more sense. Having gamepass and back compatibility is a huge plus as well. Overall, I am so happy I bought this gaming machine. Again, you can wait a while as buying it now isn't a must just yet but ehen you do, you will appreciate the leap forward.

  Runs cool, runs quiet, and it's a powerhouse for the value. Everything I expected and more. Running assassins creed valhalla 4k at 60fps locked is freaking cathartic. Load times are practically non existent, not having to wait between loading screens helps maintains immersion like I didn't expect.DO NOT BUY FROM SCALPERS, they are scum of the earth opportunists. Wait a couple months for the farse to end and grab one in store. Would be soooooo satisfying if all these jackasses ended up stuck with consoles they can't sell, that way it puts them in the hole.

  This game console has 12 teraflops - that's almost 10 times as many teraflops as my previous game console (the Xbox One, which only had 1.4 teraflops). Needless to say, I won't be needing any additional teraflops for quite some time, as this game console more than satisfies my need for teraflops. Highly recommended if you are in need of 12 teraflops (or, 12 trillion flops).

  If you are able to get your hands on the xbox it is a great system. very quick on every aspect although if you do not have a TV that can support it, you will not be able to experience the full range of the xbox. 4k at 120 fps is the optimal performance that the xbox can currently be used at. My tv has the ability for this although it does not have the proper HDMI port of 2.1. MY tv has 2.0 which can only support 4k at 60 fps or 2048 at 120 fps. so this is something to pay attention too!

  Going from Xbox One S to the Series X is almost night and day. High refresh rate, Xbox one X enhanced games, quick resume, fast loading, and just better performance overall. Controller feels great and probably my favourite one so far, only thing that’s annoying is that the Y button isn’t super responsive, not sure if it’s a minor defect or all the controllers have it but that’s the only downside (it won’t ruin the gaming experience). Once these consoles get a restock, definitely try to snag this.

  I purchased this console for my boyfriend, and within three days of setting it up, we started getting error codes. Then the Xbox randomly started shutting off and not turning back on. After two weeks it was basically unusable. I returned it with no problem and received the replacement a few days later. Unfortunately, we had the EXACT same issues with them next console so we returned it for a full refund. I've never had any previous issues with electronics from Amazon, so I was very surprised to have problems with these.

  If your fan is making a grinding noise, send it back. Got a refund, ordered another one and I’m happy to say it’s whisper quiet. The only thing you should really hear is the mass quantity of air being moved through this thing. Back of the box feels like a hair dryer when running 4K but this is normal. Microsoft has been putting out some really impressive hardware in recent years and this is no exception.Witcher 3 in 4K is a great upgrade. Halo 5 feels like it was made to be in 4K.360 games in 4K are a real stand out feature. Red dead in 4K is a game changer.  Halo 3 in 4K is pretty amazing as well.

  Y'all really just sent me a broken Xbox One X. Just unboxed it and plugged into a brand new 4k TV. The light turns on and it makes the noise but it doesn't connect to the TV and the remote doesn't connect to the Xbox. It wont turn off and I dont want to just unplug it from the power source. This isn't even a slight issue like cosmetic damage or anything. This thing straight up doesn't work.

  The Xbox One X is my 3rd Xbox system, having owned the 360, Xbox One and now the X. I've enjoyed them all - and the X is by far, the most polished in terms of user experience and user interface. The X truly lives up to the hype of being incredibly fast and delivering superior visuals - as well as audio (Dolby Atmos!) - compared to any other console in existence.1) Product design:The Xbox One X's design is noteworthy for it's small footprint, quiet operation and effective cooling. I have mine in an open-faced cabinet (an old dresser converted to an entertainment center) and it stays just warm to the touch under heavy load. I love how the power transformer is built into the box, requiring just a regular power cord to be used; I hated those bulky bricks that always seemed to take up too much space behind the cabinet, or on the floor. The aesthetics of the Xbox One X would be best described as 'modern minimalism'. It's not beautiful, nor is it ugly. It's just simple and non-offensive - which is ok in my book. Many other reviewers have commented on the weight of this thing. It IS solid and it's heft conveys an impression of quality; according to the specs the One X is about 1.4lbs heavier than the One.2) UX/UI:Over the generations of Xbox consoles, I've always felt the UX/UI has always been a step or two behind Playstation. With the release of the One X, there is a new UI which is much less cluttered than the past versions, which is a welcome improvement. There are still some odd navigational design choices than baffle me, such as the odd placement of the ""view all"" button when perusing the Store categories and the seemingly random Home screen layout. It takes some getting used to - but once you do, those gripes become negligible. Microsoft could definitely take a page out of Sony's design book however...The One X's speed also helps to improve the snappiness of the interface/experience; gone are the lags and pauses of the previous generations. This was one of the first things I noticed with the X - and it's a very welcome improvement.3) Visuals/Audio:The upgrade to 4K/HDR gaming was more noticeable than I expected it to be. In HDR mode, the image (on my Samsung UHD TV) is super-bright and free of color banding (thanks to 10 or 12 bit color rendering options). Framerates are much more consistent and fluid. Aliasing just seems non-existent now. For those interested, the One X has native 4K games and games that are ""checkerboard rendered"" to 4K - the latter of which is what the PS4 Pro was crucified for doing. Visually, native 4K and checkerboard 4K may be hard to distinguish, depending on the game.Audio also gets a nice improvement as well with the addition of Dolby ATMOS. My Samsung HW-K850 supports it - but getting the Xbox One X to allow me to select Atmos output was a royal pain in the a$$. To get Atmos to work, you're first prompted to download the (kinda) free Dolby Access app (I say 'kinda' free, because there is an 'Atmos for headphones' option that will cost you $15 to enable). The Dolby app then guides you through the necessary settings you must enable on the Xbox - but this is where it went awry in my case. I kept getting an error code when attempting to enable Atmos - and after chatting with Microsoft support, they had no ideas and chalked it up to a bug that would need to be patched. I did stumble across a solution, in which you must also enable a setting in the TV & One Guide section; ""Audio"" must be set to ""surround"" (instead of the default ""stereo uncompressed"" in that menu too - something the Dolby app (and Microsoft support) missed. I also had to shut off every device in my system, unplug the power from everything for an hour, then turn everything back on to finally get Atmos sound to work. I can only guess this had something to do with renewing the HDMI handshakes between all devices. While I'm not removing a star for this, it is something that *should* be easier to make work.4) Other features:Coming from the Xbox One w/ Kinect, I had opted to connect my cable box (Charter/Spectrum) - which offers the most outdated and terrible guide/menu in the known universe. Connecting it to the Xbox allows you to use the One Guide instead which is much nicer. The Kinect was able to control all the functions of the cable box, which made a nice, seamless experience. I was concerned that I would have to buy the Kinect adapter cable for the X to retain this functionality, but was pleasantly surprised to find out that the Kinect wasn't necessary, as the X has it's own IR blaster built-in. As long as you don't  have any components behind closed cabinet doors, the X's IR blaster is powerful enough to send out the necessary signals. I am now Kinect sensor free!Another nice feature of the X is the fact it plays UHD Blu-Ray discs. I have not played one yet, but knowing that visually, it should be superior to streaming UHD content (from VUDU, Netflix, Amazon, etc), I know it will be awesome. UHD/HDR streaming IS awesome by the way; the elimination of color banding is perhaps the most welcome benefit, aside from the increase in resolution.5) Final thoughts:Overall, this console is a true performer. If there are any negatives, it would be with the relatively small standard HDD. At 1TB, one may question why this is a negative; After all, the S comes standard with a 500GB HDD. The issue here, is that for games that take advantage of 4K resolution, typically offer higher-resolution textures to go along with it - which, according to Microsoft, can inflate game size by 33% or more. The extra space quickly becomes consumed and the number of games that can be installed at any one time remains about the same as previous generations - which was always a point of contention with users. Of course, you can buy an external drive to overcome this issue - but that is one more thing to buy. I feel that Microsoft may have missed the mark on this one; Why tout the most powerful console ever, and pair it with a HDD that is honestly too small? It's like putting crappy tires on a performance vehicle. But, alas, I hesitate to remove a star for this, as I personally don't play more than a few games at a time - I don't think it will become much of an issue for me.

  While this looks great in 4k, the big winner is the performance. Even if you dont own a 4k tv, you can appreciate how much smoother games run on it.

  I waited several months to purchase this system due to the $500 price tag.  I had a 1st Gen Xbox One that I was looking to upgrade for use with my 55"" 4K HDTV, but it seemed a bit pricey for just an upgrade in speed/graphics/storage.  If the price would have been set at $300/$400, I probably would have bought one right out of the gate.  I ended up picking one up when the offered the Sea of Thieves bundle.  So far, I'm very happy with my purchase.  The upgrade in graphic/speed is clearly noticeable on a 4K TV, and the extra storage is nice with 3 people in the house all playing different types of games.  I still think the $500 price tag is too high, but watch for a deal!  This is the best game console on the market in my opinion!

  Solid console. Super fast and 4k content is amazing. Bluray works well and is controlled via tv remote. I haven't had a disconnect yet which was a constant problem on my play station. I didn't rate 5 stars due to game controller uses physical batteries instead of rechargeable, however, 2 AA lasted almost 2 weeks on heavy gameplay. A word of caution that 4k consumes massive data, I almost hit my allotment on Xfinity in a month.The games are massive storage hogs and having big Xbox is a must.

  After just a few months the Console started acting up showing the E101 and E102 error codes at first, eventually evolving into a E105 error code. These suggested hardware issues, and unit had to be sent to Microsoft for repair.The console has a manufacturing date of October 2017, though was sold to me by Amazon in June, 2018.Save yourself the trouble, and buy a new console directly from the Xbox Store.

  I’ve been a Xbox gamer since the 360. I had the original fat Xbox 1 and games were starting to get bogged down and crashing, especially the new COD:BO4. I recently upgraded to a 4K tv and figured since the price came down for the start of the holiday season to buy it. All I can say is wow, it was like going from standard definition gaming to HIgh definition all over again. COD:BO4 is running so much better now and hasn’t crashed yet. I would highly recommend the X1X! (Photo shows Directv box on top of the Xbox 1 X.)

  Did not work properly,  couldn't install mods or add on files for my game. Also, during the install process, it erased my data files from my old xbox one and somehow corrupted the disk.  My old unit will not load those files anymore either and it was working just fine prior to installing this broken unit. Tried to upgrade my system, now my files are all gone and neither unit works now.  Trying to return,  seller seems to be less than interested in refunding my purchase price.  After a barrage of technical questions,  they said they will have to test the unit before deciding how to proceed with my refund request.  I'm not happy at all with this purchase,  feels like a giant rip-off coming my way.

  Ok. So, if you're here, I'll make the presumption you are actually looking to buy an XBOX One and aren't a PS4 or PC Snob. And having owned the original XB1 and the XB1S, let me be the one to tell you this: You've been doing it wrong this whole time! I play a lot of Destiny 2..it's embarrassing... (so you can love it or hate it. It's whatever) And the MAIN issue I have with that game and other games (FarCry5, Red Dead 2, Fallout 4, etc) is LOAD TIMES! You don't THINK a 2 minute load time is a lot, until you've spend 20minutes of the last hour simply loading in to one place or the another, You don't THINK getting to the halfway point in a Strike and your toon hovering in midair as it Loads the next area while your Fireteam is rushing past you...until you get a set up where all that goes away. From the time I push the button to start and my character selection team comes up is less that 30 sec. It used to be over 2 minutes. From there, the same a 2 minute what until I show up in orbit (now typically 25-30 sec). I can load into the Leviathan (it's a raid, don't get wrapped up in the game jargon) and be standing on the entrance before my team even loads in.  It pretty awesome. And that's not even the game performance and visual improvements, reduced lag, etc. That's all been beat to death. But Load times... wow. What a difference.  Now, here's a kernel for you to chew on. I also have an and external SSD drive. But I have played the game on the internal AND External drives. The load times are pretty similar with no more than 2-3 sec differences from what I can see. However, I played this Same SSD through my XB1S and its an enormous difference. Load times through the SSD are pretty much just as fast on XB1S as they are on XB1X. But the internal drive on XB1S ; it's like a race between the tortoise and the hare, except the hare stomped on the tortoise as it zoomed past!Anyway, if you can eat the cost, get the XB1X and enjoy the games like they were meant to be before the next gen consoles launch.

  I'm a PlayStation gamer as I've always been. However, I like having all three systems (Xbox and Nintendo) so I'm not limited when there are exclusives. I bought this just for the 4k player and a few exclusives, i.e. SOD2. However, when compared side by side with a PS4 Pro it's not even close. It blows it out of the water in every single aspect.I now find myself trading in PS4 titles for the same game on the 1X so I can enjoy REAL 4K HDR gaming.

  Great improvement over the 'S' model on my OLED.  Middle Earth Shadow of War looks amazing!  MS did a good job speeding up the interface.  Console runs very quietly and is easily the best designed Xbox in the lineup.  Really looking forward to more 4K games!

  Es sorprendente, funciona fluida la interfaz respecto a la xbox one original (fat), los juegos a 4K de resolución son un sueño y todo se ve como si estuvieses dentro de él, Red Dead Redemption 2 a 4K con HDR en la Xbox One X es tan impresionante que no me emocionaba tanto desde la salida de Crysis en 2007.La consola responde a todo, la calidad de todos sus juegos como ya dije es impresionante y más sub los últimos títulos, la capacidad de tomar capturas de pantalla a 4K y vídeos es increíble, el gamepass es un tremendo acierto que por 10 dólares tengas más de 100 juegos, con la consola te viene 1 mes de game pass y 14 días de live gold.El mando es igual al de la Xbox One S sólo que en negro mate, tiene excelente sujeción a las manos e increíble respuesta, la consola prácticamente es inaudible, aún jugando durante horas y horas no calienta ni es ruidosa, su disco duro es suficiente para la mayoría de personas aunque yo preferiría uno de 2TB por la gran cantidad de juegos que tengo instalados.Como centro multimedia es impresionante también, youtube y Netflix a 4K funcionan de maravilla y el HDR en Netflix es otro mundo, excelente el reproductor Blu-ray 4K y Dolby atmos.La recomiendo totalmente, no importa si tienes una tv o monitor 1080p , no te lo pienses y comprala sin dudar.

  I've owned a 4k Tv for almost two years now and prior to owning the Xbox One X I haven't had any devices capable of showing off 4k resolution. I have to say I wasn't expecting much of an upgrade from 1080p HD TV but wow the One X blew me away! The games that are enhanced have never looked better. Even PUBG was given the 4k treatment and it really makes the game stand out. Even if your playing a game that hasn't been visually enhanced for the One X it will still run the game better. We tried WWE 2K18 and those games are known for their long load times and choppy gameplay. Well the load times are still long but the gameplay is freakishly smooth. We can now play 8-man matches with no lag whatsoever! Something I didn't think would ever be possible in that game. That just shows you how much power the One X brings to the table. Navigating the home screens and menus have never been faster and the same goes for watching game clips. Your internet speed can affect this but if your internet is fairly fast, watching a recorded clip is almost instantaneous. No more sitting and waiting 30-60 seconds for the clip to load or finish playing.My one and only complaint with the One X and the reason I docked it a star is the fact that it only comes equipped with a 1 TB hard drive.  1000 gigabytes sounds like a lot of storage but when it comes to the One X nothing could be further from the truth. I own about 56 games altogether and so far I've installed 10 games on the One X and have already used about 57% of the consoles storage capacity. This is extremely irritating since I know it won't be long until I'm forced to buy another external hard drive to make up for the consoles lack of storage. The original Xbox One suffered from this issue as well. From a consumer point of view, its kind of a cheap marketing ploy.Its like they sat down and said lets make an awesome system that looks and performs better, and even though its a requirement to install every game on the hard drive as well as downloading the big 4k updates, let's go ahead and limit the storage. Seriously microsoft? For $500 we should have got 2 TB of storage, at least. How in this day and age of gaming can you put such a tiny hard drive on an otherwise awesome console? Especially when certain games take up so much space. I was shocked when I installed Gears of War 4 and found out it took up 111 GB of space! Yeah 111 gigs, what a joke. That's already 10% of the hard drive right there. I don't care if a game needs a lot of storage to run properly but at least give us the space to make it work! Thats like building a minivan and only putting two seats in it.I honestly don't understand why they don't just offer another version of the Xbox One X with a 2 TB hard drive for $600. They might as well because when I go purchase another external hard drive I'm going to have to pay another $100 anyways; at least it would save me the trouble. Which is exactly what I did with the original Xbox One. So in retrospect I actually spent $600 on the original and new Xbox One totalling $1200. You see my point? Hopefully microsoft will learn from this and fix it for the next console.So other than the storage issue this is a great console. I was on the fence about buying it but I'm glad I did. The performance alone makes up for the small hard drive. A huge benefit if you already own an Xbox One is that you'll be able to play a lot of games together on both consoles that you normally couldn't on one console. If you own a 4k TV I highly recommend picking one up. And if you don't I've heard games still look fantastic on 1080p HDTVs. Do not underestimate the power this Xbox packs. If you can't see the difference you'll definitely feel it.

  I have been an xbox player from the beginning and never had so many problems with an xbox.  3 months in and I have already factory reset once, and hard resetting >6 times just so it will start up is the norm.  I am so sad that I purchased this without support as I have never needed it until now.  I have searched all the forums and unfortunately I think my xbox is faulty so I will have to send it in for repairs.Advice, purchase any unlimited service plans and warranties.

  Going from an Xbox One Day One Edition with a failing internal hard drive to an Xbox One X is quite a substantial upgrade. Outside of the speed and reliability there isn't much of an interface difference, which I personally enjoy.The packaging was well-kept and simplex, which is something that is highly underrated, in my opinion. Came with all the standards needed to get started; a month of gold, power supply cable, HDMI cable, etc. Out of convenience I am pleased to have an internal power supply. With that said, however, I am slightly uncomfortable with the idea of having another internalized part that is notorious for failing after some time and not having the ability to easily switch it out but hey, I guess Microsoft has to sell new consoles somehow. For example, the Xbox has been built with internal storage since the 360 Slim, and because of this internal storage I was forced to get a new Xbox when my hard drive failed. Unfortunately, getting an external still doesn't protect you from the OS that needs to be ran on the internal drive.I'll update my review when I've had a chance to see how the Xbox One X enhanced games run.

  This console was sold as new but was manufactured in 2017 and the warranty had expired before we purchased it in December 2019.  We only learned this when we contacted Microsoft because the product did not work and we provided the serial number to Microsoft.  I consider this a fraud on an unsuspecting buyer.

  I have 2 original Xbox One consoles that still work great but this ""better"" console only lasted a year and a half!?  Video started flickering on and off during play the other day.  I powered it on today and have the dreaded no signal/black screen.  Tried all the YouTube suggestions for hard reset and low-res mode boot, but nothing works.  Warranty expired 5 months ago, which is very disappointing.  Opening a repair with Microsoft for $250 isn't wise, as I bought an Xbox One S last Black Friday for $155 shipped.  I was getting excited to buy the newest version this year, Series X, but this let-down has changed my mind.  I won't purchase Xbox equipment in the future.

  If you aren't aware the Xbox One X models have an issue where the HDMI port will suddenly stop working.  Mine is no exception.  I wish I would have known this going into it.  Paying $500 for something that stops working is not worth it.

  Believe all the other reviews.  I traded in a fairly new Xbox One S to buy this and it's one of the best purchases I've ever made.  I'm in love.(The S is a great machine in its own right - I don't mean to disparage it at all.  But it's no X.)

  Physically, I like the smaller footprint of the console. I often play at my buddy’s house and this console is a lot easier to manage. As for its other features like higher processing speeds and 4K video, I haven’t noticed any difference. It could be that I don’t play any games that require those features. I have a 4K TV, but my games are not. Overall, I don’t notice a difference between the Xbox One and the Xbox One X. I don’t regret my decision to upgrade, but unless you have a need for the X’s “features”, I would hold up on buying one. Again, I have no regrets and I do like the smaller footprint.

  Games that used to push my Xbox One to the limit now run like butter. I've yet to encounter a single dropped frame. Even at 1080p the downscaled 4K assets are a breath of fresh air. The console is also whisper-quiet, and stays cool to the touch. Worth getting even if you don't have a 4K TV that supports HDR.It's certainly smaller than the Xbox One - the smaller footprint is much appreciated. The matte black finish means that it doesn't attract fingerprints. Its simple looks mean that it doesn't stand out aesthetically, but it really doesn't have to. It's much more understated than the Xbox One S. Removing the cumbersome power brick is a welcome change.While it was a necessary omission, the lack of a Kinect port does render that peripheral useless without paying an arm and a leg for an unwieldy adapter. I used the Kinect for voice commands fairly often and don't want to resort to buying another piece of equipment just to use them (nor is a headset an ideal option).With the 4K graphical assets you should expect your download sizes to be noticeably larger and will fill up your available storage space quickly. With a 1TB hard drive being the only available option currently, you may end up having to invest in an external hard drive.If you mainly use your console as more of an all-around entertainment machine, the One S may be better suited to your needs and deliver more bang for your buck. It's hard to justify the $499 price tag when the One S is $200 cheaper, but if you're looking for the best possible gaming experience without switching platforms, the One X really is the best way to go.Games Played: Forza Horizon 3, Forza Motorsport 7, Halo 5: Guardians, Destiny 2, Quantum Break, Monster Hunter: World, Assassin's Creed: Origins, Gears of War 4

  Great product! If you like Xbox, you’ll love this.I had an experience worth sharing as well: a lightning surge fried my first One X (while it was hooked up to a surge protector). After a phone call or two, I got a replacement for the price of shipping and a week or two wait.Definitely would recommend if you want a gaming console or even just to watch HQ videos. It’s quiet and powerful.

  Probably not a necessary upgrade from a standard XB1, but still a great item to own. Responsive, good update management (you're not installing an update every time you try to use it like other consoles), will allow resume on more than one game, and currently has the best controller on the market.

  Reviews said I would get better graphics than my ps4 and it is 4hd. What’s not to like? Due to poor internet access I have a four hour window to use this machine and Microsoft then demands a update immediately. So the box does what the master says. And I am locked out until it complete. My experience might be better if I was closer to a cell tower but I think not. FYI won’t play movie discs unless connected to the net. Microsoft needs to know all. Goodwill is going to get a early Christmas presents.

  The Xbox had been working well, it was fast, reliable and fun to play. One day I got a startup error, I reset the xbox and nothing worked. I tried the remove everything option, but in a few days, the error popped up again and again. This had happened occurred before 6 months of ownership. I'm disappointed about it's random errors and it cannot be fixed.

  I was paranoid of ordering this at first as a gift just because of the technical issues people were having with their Xbox and thinking it could be damaged through process and handling since mailmen can throw packages at times. But I am more than satisfied with my purchase. It came in brand spanking new, with Xbox live gold and a game pass. It was well packaged and secured. It came with a remote. It started up perfectly and has been working great since! I recommend to everyone reading my review to give it a chance because every online purchase can have its pros and cons. But this one was definitely all pro! Thank you so much, happy holidays!

  Bought this for my husband for Christmas last year.  Around July of this year the player started melting DVD's and games after only playing for about 15-20 minutes. The player would freeze and wouldn't play. I am not a gamer, so I bought this thinking it would play his old xbox games without issue..not that case, you have to pay online fees and download needed software to get the older games to play. None of this was disclosed anywhere ""I"" could find. Very disappointed in this game console. Guess he will go back to the PS3-4 players. I have reached out to XBox for support and help for refunds and replacement and all I get is ...""I'm sorry, unfortunately, we can't help you, the productivity support time period after purchase has passed.""  Seriously...anyone have suggestions...please let me know..

  I noticed a significant graphical improvement when playing Fortnite and Black Ops 4. Note that you will only see a large improvement in games that developers made with the Xbox One X in mind (Xbox One X Enhanced titles).In Fortnite the lighting was much better with better shadows and dynamic range. The object pre-load range was extended, frame rate faster, and resolution improved. I'm using a 1440p monitor so not rendering in 4k, but even with a 1080p monitor you will see many advantages to using this console.Black ops 4 has much better texture resolution and graphical fidelity.What I don't like is the fan. The fan is noticeably louder than on the original xbox one, which is expected due to the much higher power consumption of the device. However, the fan is annoying because the fan RPM rapidly changes every second. It's not like your typical PC fan which will ramp up to a speed and slowly ramp down when not needed. I think Microsoft does this to quickly slow or quicken fan speed when desired or not needed but it is annoying.The second thing I don't like is that the built in OS takes up 250 GB of the 1 TB drive. That's not cool!Overall this is a no brainer if you game frequently.

  Takes too long to load games, and does too much stuff I really don’t want, but paid for anyway.  It’s basically a computer for your TV.  I have a computer, and it’s a really good one.  If I want to, I can hook my computer up to my TV, so why do I want an XBOX One One X?  I think one of the finest video game consoles ever made were the ones that did one thing well... play games!  Atari 2600, and Playstation, as well as the obligatory NES.  You put in a cartridge, or a CD, and boom!  Games!  I don’t need parental controls, or some kind of interface for my Netflix account, I don’t want to surf the web, or set my XBOX to order more cat-food when it senses a specific timbre in my cat’s meowing.... I just want games, I want them fast, and I want them now!  Updates!  This update will only take 45 minutes!  Would you like XBOX to look up instructions on how to bake something during that time frame so you have something to do while you are waiting to play your games?

  I don't understand why there's so much hype 'bout the new Xbox 1X. Aside from all the supposed processing specs, in terms of real life performance the Xbox 360 was 'Way Better'. Playing games on the 1X has been one of the most frustrating experiences ever on a gaming console.  The 1X is too temperamental.  The wireless controller disconnects much too often and requires too much coddling to get it to reconnect. And the problem is not with the controller as I have tried a different new one where the same thing happens. I think the 1X consoles are defective and Microsoft knows it. They need to try to do something to fix this. Looks like I will be buying a PS4 after all.

  Order the open boxes item from amazon to save a few bucks... I’ve started to realize that when they say open box it just means the box is slightly damaged.But to the info of the Xbox One X... love it! Makes PUBG and Fortnite load super quick and the graphics are stunning. For PUBG the rendering of the landscape is done before you need to jump. You can even tell that a bush is a bush!

  Ordered first console for my son and a month after using it, it died. It would not turn on. So frustrating babease you spend so much money on these consoles that you would think that these companies would have it together. It's just a make as much money as we can from the consumer even though the components are inferior. On the upside, Amazon refunded us immediately and we ordered another console. Hopefully this one isn't a lemon as well.

  I am customer outside the US I should have known better  than buying this console from a seller other than Microsoft but I wanted it fast and paid for two day shipping on top of that. I had a controller from since 2016 that I used on the original xbox one and kept the new one from the xbox one x  recently purchased. To my surprise on Christmas Day I tried connecting the new controller with a battery pack it remained connected only for a few seconds, I used lithium double A batteries same result, then I connected a u.s.b cord from the console to the controller and guess what same result, I concluded after being embarrassed in front of my guests that the controller is effectively dead. The console is working fine so far, but this has never happened to me before and I have ordered three consoles from Amazon and never experienced this problem. I will not be buying anything from this seller again.

  Wow. wooowwww. The moment you pick it up it becomes clear this is a quality product. Just the shear weight alone you know the hardware inside is as rock solid as its exterior. Insane specs that are instantly clear transitioning from the original xbox one.I made the change, because I game enough it was worth it. 1 TB of memory +2 TB external storage. I practically never need to worry about memory for a while.The screen transitions are so smooth, games like The Division, Ghost Recon, R6 Siege, Battlefield, Gears of War. They all look incredible.I went from 720p with my TV and Xbox One to 4K with a Samsung TV and The X1X and just wow. PS4 people can pretend they have the better hardware but this is literally the best spec-ed console. Outperforms the PC I built for almost 2.2k.Night and Day.

  I couldn't pass up buying an XBO-X with $100 and another $111 trade-in on my OG Xbox One. $300 was a no brainer. The new X has a better controller out of the box (textured vs smooth plastic so it's more grippy). I am playing on a very high-end 1080p plasma set and the graphical increases are noticeable on the enhanced games already in my library. Even though it doesn't let me select 10-bit or 12-bit output for some reason, the colors are still great with the full rbg option on 8-bit.I've tested with Rise of the Tomb Raider, AC: Origins, and The Division thus far. All look great and have that extra level of sharpness/smoothness (due to supersample, AA, & AF), more detailed textures, and better shadows than the OG xbox one. For $300 I think it was a steal. Load times are also better even if marginally.The ONLY regret I have is not having the kinect for voice commands anymore. It was so convenient to say Xbox On/off, Xbox Mute, etc... and not have to power up a controller or walk over and grab a remote for the TV. I hope that feature gets baked into the next generation. It one of those things you don't know you'll miss until it's gone.EDIT: Amazon Trade-In program basically did a bait and switch by rejecting my Day 1 Xbox One trade. I sent it in  packed in the original box and they said it was rejected because the ""power cord didn't work.""  Bullsh*t... It ran perfectly before I shipped it to them and guess what... It ran perfectly when I got it back. Scammed me to think I had $111 credit and turned around and billed me for that amount.DO NOT USE AMAZON TRADE-IN. YOU'VE BEEN WARNED.

  I'm not a sonyboy but this system cannot be compared to PS4 Pro in regard of smoothness and responsiveness. The main menu is slow and complicated. Microsoft always makes glitchy operating systems no matter what. Watching 4k movies is a big hassle. During 2 different movies the system froze at least 5 times without any way to get around the glitch unless you hard reboot it. My suggestion to you - if you had previously been playing PS4 or its Pro version, then you are gonna hate this system and return it back.

  Shipped quickly. Arrived in good working condition. Has seen a average of 20 to 50 hours of use per week for the last 3 months without any problem. With and without a 4k television the upgraded graphics and preformance are noticable. I wasnt sure if I was going to get more for my money, but after focusing on xbox one enhanced/4k games and streaming services I am very satisfied with my purchase. If you are a xbox owner considering the upgrade, and youre committed to the console for the forseable future, buy. PUBG, Monster Hunter World, Netflix, and many other enhanced features/ titles are much more enjoyable in contrast to their standard xbox one versions.

  The controller is awful because it loses connection if you are more than 3 feet away! They say it's because of my wireless router BUT WHY DOES MY OLD ""DAY ONE 2013"" XBOX ONE CONTROLLER WORK FLAWLESSLY AND WHY DOES THE ROUTER INTERFERE?! ROUTERS ARE EVERYWHERE NOW! But besides that it is still a xbone nothing great to really say. Better graphics and seems to be smoother game play but for the price I'm disappointed. Playstation still has a more solid system. I bought this because the optical drive in my old xbox one went bad just like with my really old xbox 360. Never had to do that with my playstations! PRAISE SONY!OH but the 1 good thing is that you can transfer game data from external drives to the internal drive with no issues and it's very easy to figure out so at least there is that.

  Nice game console. Purchased used but looks new. Everything was included and works perfectly. Warehouse deals have been consistently good and I have been buying many items used. I did need to update the xbox and controller. It is possible the person that previously purchased it didn't know that the controller needed to be updated before it could be used ( plugged in by USB, updated, then connected to Bluetooth). It has been used almost daily and is working perfectly.

  I've been an Xbox user since day 1.  This Xbox to me represents a massive improvement over the S.  Increased speed in loading is definitely noticeable.  The higher resolution and HDR on compatible TV's is RIDICULOUS.  Get ready for gaming that blurs the lines on VR without a VR headset.Playing the new Forza with the lights off and looking through a windshield doing 100+mph in the rain never looked so good...so real.Another thing I noticed right away is that it is whisper quiet.  I mean, like you can't hear this thing doing anything...I don't think I've even heard a fan yet.My only knock, is the 1TB drive will get eaten up real fast with these dang games and game updates...seems like they could have gone 2TB.Lastly, make sure you have some fast internet.  The updates to the console and 4K games are immense.

  The Xbox One X really just looks nice. I love the matte black finish and modern design. As for performance, it's the most you can get out of a console right now and makes for the perfect all in one media center. It will have all the apps you need, play all of the DVDs/Blurays/4kBlurays you like, and give you a nice gaming experience with a solid game library. Not as good of a selection as Steam on PC, but it's still plentiful with a few great exclusives such as Red Dead Redemption 2.I gave it 4 stars due to poor quality control. My Xbox One X was fully functional but had a defective fan. It was oddly loud at idle, producing a grinding sound that I could hear from across the room. Definitely a bad fan. I question the longevity of an Xbox One X and the quality of the fan. I would hope they would use a quality, reliable fan in something that couldn't function without it. That said, if your even a little tech savvy the Xbox One X is super easy to disassemble and work on. The fan would be simple to source and replace.

  I ordered this for my fiance to replace his Xbox One. He absolutely loves the One X. I like it too for watching movies. Blu rays look way better even on our non-4K TV, however I'm looking forward to getting a 4K TV now that we have the Xbox One X. As far as gaming quality he says that he hasn't come across any issues and the new COD looks really cool and doesn't lag. It costs a lot, but I think overall it is worth it since we will be using it for a long time.

  The system is impressive when it works... I've had the xbox less than a month and have problems. I'm not sure if it is my controller or the system but even though the light on the controller stays on it frequently disconnects. I've tried following the different helps I could find and nothing has worked so far... Everything, including the controller, have the most recent updates. Needless to say this is ridiculous for a system I've had less than a month.

  Update: ok apparently it’s not just my case. There are multiple cases complaining about it. Check your warranty once you received it!It’s a gift for my friend so when he opened it for the first time, it has passed the 1-month replace time form amazon.The problem is, when he tries to open it second time, it doesn’t work. There is no output from the Xbox.Ok COOL. So we tries to ask for help from Microsoft. The funny thing is, the warranty has expired! And we find a label on the back of machine saying that ‘service date 2018-04-05’ which might confirm that it is a refurbished machine!Holly cow, I paid for a new machine instead of a refurbished machine with defect! They(amazon or Microsoft or both) are deceiving their customer!Guys, take my word, no matter if it function well or not, check your warranty period on the Microsoft website once you receive it, if, you have to buy from there.

  I had purchased a One S when it first came out and wanted the One X when that came out cause of its high specs, finally bough it on black Friday for $399 and am totally happy with my purchase! I noticed a significantly higher difference in graphics between the two machines while playing Red Dead Redemption 2, love this one x so much! Still kept my one s, just moved it out to my loving room. Awesome machine, very powerful!

  I REALLY like this XBOX. It is leaps and bounds ahead of my old XBOX 1. It's getting three stars because of the chincy, cheesy power cord that came with it. When you spend this amount of money on an item such as this you would expect the peripherals to be high quality as well. The power cord is so cheaply made that it just falls out of the plug on the machine. Fortunately I had a spare that plugged right in. When you inspect something like this and one of the most obvious components fails, it makes you wonder what else is wrong with it. When I drop a huge amount of change on something I expect a quality product. Obviously someone was sleeping at the quality control department.

  Ultra disappointed in the Xbox one X.  Unit will lock up every 30 seconds to a minute.  Most games will not even open.  Every few minutes the unit will shut down due to overheat errors even though the console is in open air and well ventilated.  I have sent this unit back to Microsoft and they send it back claiming the unit is fine and all the diagnostic tests they run check out fine.  I ended up buying a normal Xbox one (Not the X) and it works just fine.  Never had it lock up once.

  Very nice console and the X Box One X enhanced games on a 4k TV really look as good as anything I've ever seen.  This box has plenty of storage and loads faster than other consoles, although the new games are big and take a good while to load (Star Wars Battlefront II for example).  Forza looks amazing on this console BTW!I've unhooked and took this on a family trip over the holidays and now back home.  It works perfect and the whole family, young and old, thoroughly enjoyed this version of Xbox!  Weighs more than I thought it would but feels very solid.  Can get pretty warm out the back of this unit.I highly recommend unless you are worried about leaving very old games behind.  For that, go on MS website and check for compatibility first.  I've ran into a few old games that will not play on this unit.The blu ray and 4k drivers also work great and we've enjoyed watching very high 4k resolution movies.

  Played with the regular XBox One S for a while and I thought that since the X runs in 4K, that the actual performance would be the same or even slower.  But no, it's actually faster in all respects, and is in 4K.  The first XBox One X I got had very bad coil whine.  If yours does, exchange it!  My new one has a very quiet fan sound but nothing like the whirrr it used to have.

  If you have the extra cash than buy it. I have a 1500$ PC and it can run some games at 4k, all games at 1080 ultra. The reason this console can do it with ease it because its had a lot more optimization. All my windows games and Xbox games run at 4k with ease. IDK how they did it but they did, and for just 495$ For 495 you won't find a 4k machine.

  The graphics on the Xbox One X Enhanced are phenomenal, and smooth. Gameplay is also smooth even with the most demanding of the newest games out there. I love this console.  The only thing that would make it better right out of the box would be to have an SSD and Bus that supports faster data transfer rates, instead of a standard hard drive. Installing a game onto the hard drive is slow and painful, and game loading can be painful as well.  Better data transfer rates would have made both of these more bearable.  My workaround is to launch a game, and then I go get a drink and snack.  By the time I get back, the game is ready to play, and so am I.

  We bought this in April 2020 (for $323 it's now much more). It's having problems where it turns off randomly.  We went to our Microsoft account to try to get it serviced. To find that the warranty expired in October 2019 - 6 months before we bought it! That's crazy.  I bought it new, I expected it to come with a normal warranty.  It worked fine until this past week. The seller doesn't control the quality of the hardware, it's not their fault it's having this glitch. The seller does control selling it with an already expired warranty.

  Worked fine for a week. Then it won't turn on. Do not buy, I know its cheaper than other versions but that's because it's an old faulty version of the console, or it's used. Going to return and get an Xbox directly from Microsoft, at least then they will fix it for me.

  Got this for $374 using Prime. A big upgrade compared to the Xbox One S model. Works great with my Vizio 4k 50"" with HDR and 120hz refresh. Games start up faster, load times are shorter (internet-300mbps dl speed). Movies (DVD, Blu-Ray, 4K UHD) and streaming look great.Still the same complaint as always with Xboxs... no built in rechargeable batteries. Come on Microsoft, get your head out of the clouds, and upgrade the controllers!

  Always been a xbox fan. I owned the xbox one s and sold it for an upgrade to this the xbox one x. The xbox one x is fantastic in every category. The graphics are unbelievable and even if they dont have as many exclusives as playstation, they at least have the exclusives i want (state of decay 2, halo, forza, gears of war 4). I bought a ps4 pro and just didnt like it as much as xbox, oh and the fact it is noticeably different. The superior graphics of the xbox and the speed of loading and downloading. I also used to leave my ps4 on for hours and it would get hot as hell. I can leave my xbox one X on all day long and the temperature will stay cool. Xbox one x 10/10 Ps4 pro 7.5/10

  This thing is great. The design and compactness of it is second to none, and it really does make games look better, even on my 1080p. I used to play final fantasy xv and Witcher 3 on the OG XB1, and playing it on the One X i see a noticeable graphical difference, especially with lighting and textures. I even brought the games over to my friends house who still games on the fat xb1 to confirm it. I can only imagine what this thing can do on a fully compatible 4k tv (like the Samsung QLEDs). If you are an xbox guy and a graphics person, this is a must buy (unless you already own a slim, then i would give it a little more thought). If you have the fat xbox, you will NOT regret upgrading to this.

  After getting my PS4 account hacked into from identity theft,,,, Sony basically shut me down and I lost everything. They wanted me to pay for all the worthless junk someone ordered or lose my account. All my games I bought, my year of Plus, all gone. I already had an Xbox One, but I bought this X and I love it. I didnt realize how much better it was on my 4K TV than my xbone and PS4 pro was. As far as im concerned, it beats my PS4 pro in every aspect. Games look better, the console itself is easier to operate, the controllers feel better, whats not to love?

  So I bought it June 30, got here on the first of July or somewhere around there. Worked perfectly until it started uninstalling and installing things on its own. It got to a point where games wouldn’t function or load, so I did a hard reset. It would not fire back up. After loading the troubleshooter (where you hold the sync and eject button simultaneously) I tried an offline update (where you download the update on a usb from a computer and use that for the Xbox to properly update) and it just shut off. Returned  yesterday and will get my money back soon hopefully. It’s like a hit or miss buying this product, sometimes they work and sometimes they don’t. If you decide to buy this, make sure yours works for a solid month and a half and if you notice anything bad or weird (uninstallations, weird noises, slowness, jumpy graphics, slow start up time, etc. ) return it immediately for a replacement. You only have 30 days, I was lucky that there customer service allowed me to return it. Very much a bunch of bogus, I guess I’ll be happier once I’m refunded. But use caution - don’t be surprised if your console begins to act funny because it just might. Everyone (including me) says “no way it’ll happen to me!” And it did, so just be cautious. Hoped this helped

  The XBOX ONE X. I don't normally write reviews, however this addition to my home theater deserves propper credence.  I made the transition from my origanal xbox one to the one x and the increase in performance is totally worth the money.  I transfered the original xbox data to the new xbox one x by connecting both units to my network and signing into my account on the new unit ( check youtube for procedure). This took quite a while,  I set both units to not go into standby and let it go.  Down to the ""grit"". The improvement from 1080p to 4k HDR ( samsung 4k display ) is pure EYE CANDY! The draw distance is greatly increased. Meaning the clarity at 75 yards around you is super sharp and the clarity 1/2 mile away in now very sharp ( RED DEAD REDEMPTION 2 ).  The frame rate in gameplay has also been boosted. Load times have been decreased and are noticeable.  I don't seem to have a difference in digital sound performance but I am not running dolby atmos on my Denon receiver yet, so I can't attest to  that.  So, if you are moving towards making the jump in the direction of enhancing your gaming experience.  The investment in a XBOX ONE X is a ""TRI AWESOME"" deal. Not to mention you can play 4K bluray media on this rig as well.

  Microsoft website and Xbox instructions say the Xbox One X should not be plugged into a surge protector because it has an internal built in surge protector but when there is a surge after the warranty expires, there is no separate guarantee for the surge protector itself.  Had a surge today and everything that was plugged into the surge protector is fine, but the Xbox that was plugged into the same outlet is fried.  How can they tell you to not plug the Xbox into a surge protector but offer no surge protection once the Xbox warranty expires???? I think I will report this to the better business bureau as well as post on facebook and maybe even right a letter to Microsoft.

  A year and a half into ownership of the most expensive console - the HDMI port is dead and frequently overheats while sitting on top of my desk with perfect airflow. The console is on a quality surge protector. I think quality control at foxcon is garbage. I now have to shell out 250 dollars to get the console replaced or repaired. 400 dollar consoles should not die after a year and a half of light use.

  I really wish I could rate this product 0 stars.Console worked grate for just a couple weeks slowly but surely I started having issues. From my controller never able to stay connected to constantly being disconnected when I play games.  I soonlearned after taking it to a Microsoft store that the console had the wrong graphics card wrong network ship and lan chip. That explained why I could never play games and when I tried it cut off and in order to connect again I had to do a factory reset on this console. The price of switching theses items out is close to the price of the console itself. As a lot of the components are designed for those pieces so they need to be replaced to. I couple of my friends who have also got this product recently have encountered the same issue with the same result as Iv had. Upon some research itself Iv learned a lot of theses consoles are faulty. The only way I can watch videos is if I’m wired. If I try to use WiFi my console can’t handle it and shuts off.

All all the issues went away. Frame rate went smooth. The graphics were noticeably better. In the game stopped freezing up. I have nothing but good to say about this new system. I also purchased a 2 terabyte external hard drive. So I could transfer my data between systems. Load times are noticeably quicker. Just a fantastic system. Thank you, Microsoft.

  Xbox is an Xbox. Be very weary of who you buy it from.  Mine was supposed to be new and came with contents spilled into a box that's too big with teo small pieces of foam and paper with all the contents of the original box spilled inside. You can see spots in it where during shipping the console smashed side to side potentially damaging it.  I decided not to trust it and to return it without testing.  Totally unacceptable.  Be wary of Neobahamutz as seller.

  After a few days of use I noticed the controller that came with it would disconnect from the Xbox.  I swapped out battery packs and even switched to alkaline batteries but it would still disconnect.  The controller didn't actually power off but I wouldn't get any response until I pulled the battery out of it and then put it back in.  If you use a cable and plug it in it works fine.At the time I was heavy into whatever I was playing so I grabbed a controller from the other Xbox and synced it and had no issues.  I continued using one of my other controllers and unfortunately for me it slipped my mind until last week when I remembered and switched back to the included controller and same thing - works fine wired but wirelessly it will disconnect.  I checked the firmware on it using Microsoft's directions and it's up to date.  So I checked the warranty and unbelievably Microsoft shows it's out of warranty?  I get that this is old stock but it's still a brand new system???  So now i'm out a controller unless I fork over 50 bucks for a new one to replace a brand new one.

  Fantastic upgrade from a “Day One” edition XBone.  Some reviews made me nervous where they claim that theirs was previously open.  In my case the worries were unfounded.  The 4K looks great obviously but the rock solid frame rate is where this continues to shine.  No more slow-downs when there’s a lot going on on the screen.  Load times are faster but not significantly changed for me.

  This is an absolutely amazing console. It has such a minimalistic and sleek design, and just looking at this beauty is enough to please one’s eyes. I read many reviews of people who claimed to receive defective units, and I did fear that I would receive one as well, but mine was and still is in perfect condition. Performance-wise, it is absolutely stellar and is pretty much comparable to a gaming PC. This console is able to display impressive graphics while maintaining a very high frame rate. To top things off, this console stays completely quiet, the user would have to be in a completely mute room to hear this console at all. I love it and this is a must-buy for any gamer.

  I’m so happy with my purchase, I use it as my makeshift entertainment center. I use the blue ray player the rare times I have a dvd to watch. I use the YouTube app to watch 4k videos. Half  of the games I own are 4k so it’s absolutely a blast to play games in 4k resolution. The system has given me no problems and have been so fun owning. I chose the xbox 1x over a ps4 because I just prefer xbox ecosystem and the draw of 4k gaming and a blue ray player made me choose it over the competition. If you choose the xbox 1x to get the best experience I would recommended using it with a 4k tv. This is my first xbox 1 system so I’m happy I waited and didn’t get thto previous systems.

  Only a couple of minor complaints that resulted in a reduction of a Star. First con was the  gash/scratch underneath the console (which does not bother me any because nobody can see underneath the xbox one x). Secondly, there was no cable for the controller. This was easily remedied since i own 2 controllers/cables & 3 rechargeable batteries already for my pc. Everything else looks to be stable. So far it seems to be a good buy, thank you.

  I was planning to go from Xbox one to the S, but I had such a hard time I decided to spend the extra money for the X. So good so far.

Looks way better with a 4K tv.Update: system works fine most of the time, but I get random freezing and crashing which powers off the system. Nice now that it’s too late to do anything about it.

  Does not play Skyrim 360. Said it was backyards compatible.Does not copy games via USB.  Have to sign up for Xbox gold.The free trial in the box had expired.Requires internet just to start, and downloaded 4 GB of updates.I just bought this because the hard drive in the 360 went out.  Thought it would load faster.  But with the network requirements (no home network) and the fact I can't play my 360 games on it, I am giving it a shot of 1.This is not an upgrade to an existing system, it is not backwards compatible and requires a home network to even start.

Now flash forward to xbox one and i have gone through 4 headsets and 5 controllers and down one xbox one system that has been in use for 1 year 3 months. Trying to go through microsoft support is ALWAYS a nightmare. About fed up with xbox and probably will just give up on the company and products.

  Last year I bought an Xbox One X. A couple weeks ago I started experienced an error where I would be booted from live/wireless network after an avg of 20 minutes. Weird I know that detail right? I was in stuck a loop of customer service for a week, and know for a fact because I was asked this same question 10 times. I was thrown around to new reps, forced to tell the same stories. Then when I finally reached someone that had answers I was told I was just barely past warranty, it was a faulty Xbox, and would cost me near price of goods to ""get it looked at"". Cannot even stream movies reliably on my Xbox. I am burnt, will not be purchasing another Xbox. I will not rearrange my apartment for my Xbox, owned by PS4 for 6 yrs no problems.

  Great console but must have a cheap network card.  Havent seen a review about this yet but it happened to numerous people on forums.  Beware buyers who plan on playing over Wifi. Terrible lag spikes every 3-5 minutes shooting from 0-10 ping to 300-800 and it ruins the game.  I have an OG xbox one in the same exact spot and it has no problems on my wifi.Theory:Microsoft made a very speedy and powerful console, but implemented a cheap or defective network card.  As shown on forums, their support seems to dodge true answers as they repeat solutions that have clearly not worked for their clients.  Microsoft must be keeping this under wraps.  Only solution for the users was to hardwire or simply return.

  The product works great, and this Xbox is a phenomenal model. Just be careful with buying used Xboxes. This was advertised as a complete package from the Amazon fulfillment and it came with just the Xbox and power cord. Customer service wanted to refund me after a return, but I had already gifted it. They had no interest in compensating me for misadvertising otherwise.

  Only gets one star because it won’t let me give none .Bought this as a birthday present for son . It was delivered very quickly. Son opened only to find out it did not work . The unit kept turning off and was not able to do anything. He was Very disappointed and I had to go out and buy a another one from local store . Now have to ship this one back and wait 10 days or so for the money back . Guess the old saying is true , you get what you pay for .

  I wish I had never purchased this console. We bought this for our grandchild’s birthday.  You would think for $600 for the console and $50 a game we could insert the game, hit okay, and enjoy it. Wrong. Three weeks later, after entering emails, setting up Microsoft accounts, going through help videos, and countless other things, it is nothing but an expensive mistake. We don’t want to play online, we don’t want online games, we don’t want to play in groups, we don’t want to play with other friends, we just wanted to insert the game and enjoy playing with our grandchild. We should have ourchased a Nintendo Switch for a lot less money and frustration.

  over hyped as the most powerful system on the market.. i purchased expecting the most powerful system on the market and it did less than deliver. i could tell little or no difference in my current Xbox one: master chief edition and the new Xbox one x that is reportedly more powerful..  this system did boost the graphics BUT i also purchased a new high end gaming monitor at the same time.  so the graphics boost may or may not be due to the new console..  i would not recommend upgrading to this console..

  This Xbox kept refusing to save my progress and I had to keep deleting my player game data and re-download it multiple times during each session. It was too much for me to wait 45 minutes each time and my game data was messed up. The return shipping was over 30.00, so I'm still out for something that was supposed to be PRIME.

  Bought to play 4k games and TV.  Works well after getting 4k settings tuned to my receiver and projector setup.  Can take some time to get this correctly setup.  Loads games faster than Xbox One S with excellent 4k picture quality.  Worth the upgrade when paired with a 4k display.

  This System is better then the past XBox's before it with slower CPU's.  A fair System if you want to try any Games not on the PlayStation 4.  The down side is Microsoft bribes you to pay for 2 things,  XBox live gold & Xbox game pass.  Now the next XBox is coming in 2020 & Microsoft might try to charge a 3d Payment for Cloud Storage.  If you have a PC Desktop then use this over paying for 3 different Microsoft Subscriptions.  This is an Adult Opinion,  If I were a Teenager again with no Income, then maybe the Subscription is okay, if your Parent will pay the 180$ for a Year or 10$ a Month & 60$ for 1 year of XBox Gold.  Microsoft could still fail again after a horrible System Market Past.

  The console looks amazing, and everything runs quite smooth, I recently had an interesting glitch however on the dash, it froze for like 15 seconds, at least 3 times... anyone else experiencing this issue? It was when I was downloading SW Battlefront 2... not sure if it was a memory cache issue or something with the dash itself... IdkOther than that it has beautiful graphics that you can tell are a step up from the One S depending on the game your playing and the type of 4K tv you have.

  Console worked great for 6 months and then suddenly started malfunctioning (HDMI connectivity). Had geek squad come out and try to fix it (swapped cables, swapped TVs, messed with video fidelity settings, etc) and nothing fixed it. Eventually they told me to see about getting a replacement, because it was apparently a problem with the Xbox itself. Contacted the seller and they said no. “The item is past amazon return timeframe”. Okay, but Microsoft gives them a 24 month auto warranty on new consoles. It should cost them nothing to help me out.Don’t buy here or if you do get the extended warranty.

  The Xbox One X is beautiful and sleek. The picture quality is AMAZING. I see such a difference from my previous Xbox One. I honestly think it’s worth more than the price they’re asking. It feels crazy to say that because I am a frugal person. But it is literally the best quality I’ve seen in a console. I bought it for my boyfriend and he’s more than happy with it! He highly recommends anybody to buy this Xbox. It also came with a badass controller. I got it in all black and I think it compliments our living room nicely!

  Like many others on here I too received a faulty Xbox. Since day one it has continually given me the black screen of death when connecting to 4K, likely due to a faulty hdmi port on the console.  Now after a few months it has completely kicked the bucket. It will no longer connect to my tv at any resolution. I have tested it on multiple TVs using multiple hdmi cables and it is without a doubt a faulty console.

  Best hardware I've seen in a home console! Looks incredible on my 1080p plasma. Night and day difference.  The system Xbox should have released in the first place. Ready to get a 4K OLED next year. Only downside is Microsoft needs to get back to creating exclusive games outside of the couple dated feeling franchises they seem to depend on.  Fallout 4 is like a new game it looks so incredible along with ffxv, Wolfenstein 2, Halo, Gears and Forza. Also, I was blown away by how good old games look. Soul Caliber IV and Ninja Gaiden Black look almost like modern games!

  I had 1 ps4 day one , 1 Ps4 Pro, 1 day One Xbox One and a Nintendo Switch in my house hold before I got this and baby boy you I gotta tell you this my favorite system out of all of them. It's fast, great design and just plain good quality. I can't speak on the graphics seeing as how I'm not getting a 4k TV till tomorrow and using my current TV as a reference would just be a disservice to this magnificent piece of hardware. I will say though, if you're on the fence about getting a Xbox One X please remember the next generation of consoles releases next year. (Scarlet) but if you can afford it then do yourself a favor and get the current most powerful console on the console on the market .

  Unfortunately I didn’t have a chance to use it all that much when I first got it. Once I used it, there were all sorts of memory issues.  The units consistently had to be reset to the factory settings, which were performed. Now all it gives me is an error message that does not let me make the factory resets.  I feel as if I was sold a car with a faulty engine.  The one star is for the times it did work without trouble.  Spent $400 on a big paperweight. Buyer beware!

  I opened this box on November 8th and attempted to play several dvd's through the Blu-Ray app as well as several 360 Game discs that I confirmed were on the Backwards compatible list from Microsoft. None of these Discs were recognized, and nothing at all happened when they were inserted. Due to its used condition, its ""1-year warranty"" ran out over a year before I purchased it ""Used - Like New"" from this seller, so I am unable to get it repaired without extra cost on top of the cost to ship it to a repair facility, not to mention the Delay because of the Pandemic. I am in the process of getting it replaced and will update my review when I have a functioning device.

  I have 3 Xbox Ones, and WOW is this better than the previous 2.

The loads times are not much faster than the ""S"", but the graphical power is a huge upgrade over previous versions.  Worth it if you have the money to spend.

  This is one of the consoles that I've been wanting for a long time. Xbox One X enhanced games just look amazing. Games load faster than how they were on the base Xbox One.However, there are a few things which I found disappointing with the console itself, and something that everyone needs to know. Its DVR doesn't record 1080p 60fps if you're using a 1080p TV; it only records 30fps. You need to have a 4K TV just to record 1080p 60fps. Even though it's supposed to accept USB 3.0/3.1 as an external storage, the console doesn't accept it if you're using a thumb stick USB 3.0 flash drive that's below 32 GB. It only accepts if it's 32 GB and above or you're using a HDD.

  As a lifelong Xbox fan, I’ve wanted an X since they got released and had to wait for the price to go down due to financial priorities. Found this one for a good deal and decided to finally treat myself. I was a bit worried after reading some reviews, but after several months of being used on a daily basis for several hours at least (either for gaming or for streaming services) I’ve had absolutely no issues with it. I wanted to wait awhile before reviewing to see if anything changed, but as good as when I first got it! Shortly after purchasing I went on a trip and took it in my carry-on and had no issues starting it up right away even after air travel and being lugged around in my backpack and taken out for the X-rays. No loud fans, no weird noises, no red ring of death (lol) and I’ve noticed an improvement in my gameplay and less crashing for games as well as finally being able to properly enjoy my 4K tv. Will definitely update my review if anything changes but I’m very satisfied for now!

   First off, the original review was 2 stars, I'm changing this to one, purely because of the fact that it wasn't what's advertised, on top of the fact more people will see this.Now, I'm not sure what I should say here. I'm torn at the moment. I bet you're asking, why? I'll start from the beginning.  Let's go back in time, a few months, around early June. I was in the market for a One X, Forza was relevant and hot within my group, and I needed an upgrade from my Xbox 360. This was an extremely odd phase for Microsoft, as almost no One X's could be found new from their site. I took a peek at Microsoft's pricing as well. It was considerably lower than comparable vendors. All right, fine. This is about the period I would be scouring the internet, high and low, as I didn't want a One S, as that was seemingly an Xbox One in color, white, which I see as boring, and tasteless. If that's your thing, go for it, but I'm not feeling it. ESPECIALLY with the ""all-digital"" variation. So one day, I gave up after searching for long. Hard throughout more trusted distributors (i.e., Target, Best Buy, Even Gamestop), I eventually settled on Amazon of all places. Of course, I knew something of a rarity, especially being discontinued, would lead to some 'loose ends' somewhere, boy, I was right on that. I ordered with blind faith, ultimately hoping for the best. Order received. Great! Now I've got a One X on the way, an abnormally long shipping estimate, so just like any kid in a candy store would do, I start digging through the internet trying to learn every single thing about this Console. I see many reviews, unboxings, impressions, and I'll be honest, It's got me in a very excited state. The shipping date changes. It comes a few days early. Great! However, the package requires a signature. Ok. I'll get home from work, and I'll play on my Xbox and get lost in the immersive gaming experience! Let's say that's not what happened... Fortunately, someone was at my place when the Xbox came in, so it was signed for, thank god. All right! I open the box, and I'm blown away! It's such a clean looking professional box. That's great! As the Console had been discontinued at this point, I felt like the luckiest guy in the world. I opened the box; however, from my seller, I could tell this was substantially different from the Microsoft experience, at least as far as I was concerned. I was missing My Xbox Live Gold, My Documentation, Everything! But I didn't know about this at the time. Little did I know as well. My warranty was already missing a majority of its lifespan. I open the box, I take extra care as not to damage anything, The Console seems to be in really nice physical condition, weighs a lot as expected, but something feels off, ""Seattle -> You"" badge seems really sloppy, I take it was likely refurbished with a Chinese case after some heavy use, or a very careless/'unknowing as to how to care to it' ownership.  Not a problem. To me, It's just an Xbox that got lost in quality control, oh well. Well, I got everything plugged in. It started. However, I noticed something... odd... The startup '4K Chip' Scene was extremely laggy. I tested this on my 4K TV and my 1080p monitor. Same result. Odd.  This detail wasn't a problem. On Reddit, others said this could occur after just a few days. I downloaded Forza Horizon 4. I had played FH4 on PC for a while. I bought this Xbox to use multiplayer as my PC was inoperable in that field. I have a decent computer, so I know how lovely the graphics are. After getting all of my content synced, I was able to play. Now, I get this was a 400 dollar console new, but this didn't look very good. Constant stuttering, like it, had been hit with a hammer a few times for sure. I wasn't sure what to expect, considering I was so new in this field, but with bold claims like ""Xbox One X Enhanced,"" among others, I was expecting a little better. Marketing hoo-ha (Read till the end, I'm not nitpicking) as far as I'm concerned. Now, This is all right. I bought Xbox Live Gold as it was an excellent deal at the time. Now, I started downloading other things and testing features. My controller was nice. I liked the way it felt for sure. That's one of the nice parts about the One X I received. I also read that there was a 4K Blu-Ray Player on board, so that's pretty awesome. I tried it out with a generic DVD. It was a brand new movie. I put the disc in. I felt a little resistance at first, oh well. It went in; the movie looked nice, what a nice feature! I pulled the disc out to put it away, well, unfortunately, It's scratched. Not sure if it was the quality of the CD or what, live and learn is what they say. As I experimented, I realized I didn't have a good home for this Xbox, It didn't work as advertised, and I let it stand for a while. I just had zero urge to play. I was ultimately depressed. I spent this much money on a used piece of junk. I put it in the box and left it in the corner for a while. Now, This is one of the EXTREMELY RARE stories that has both sides of the story. Shortly after, I was browsing Microsoft again for one of these, even though I thought it was going to be the same result. *Add to Cart* Are you telling me, I can buy a new one of these... from Microsoft? I dropped everything I was doing and bought it on the spot for 38 dollars less than the one from Direct Distributor. Great! The best part? One. Day. Delivery. That was AMAZING to have it overnighted for 15 dollars shipping. You can tell I was likely pretty excited. I unboxed it, and It had all the documentation I wanted, plus extra! Now, this Console was a late 2017 model, which I've heard are pretty prone to overheating. I bought a vertical stand for it, similar to the one from Project Scorpio. It gives the Console enhanced airflow. At this point, from my old Console to this, with a cooked graphics card on the original, I take extra precautions every time I use this one. It has it's own corner, and it gets moved to the center of the desk every time it has the lovely time of being used. Now, This one has ZERO lag on startup. It was AMAZING! I got Forza installed, it runs almost perfectly, not PC level, but It's nice. I have about 50 hours into it now. I play it less these days because of time restraints; however, It was night and day difference. Skyrim runs awesome, of course. The Blu-Ray is even better (and doesn't bite). The controller was revision #1, so not the same. However, a controller is much easier to replace than a whole unit, especially discontinued. I still believe I got an Xbox One X from the last batch Microsoft will ever sell. On top of this, My warranty was in full, and I've got my whole Console again. The wifi is smooth, the browsing is great, and this thing is my queen, practically. What should you take from this? Well, from the time of writing this, The Xbox Series S is 300 and will be up for preorder seven days from now, available right in time for the holidays. SO MUCH POWER for so little money, The Series X costs less than a wild card Xbox One X on here. Now, Here's The Verdict.Seller: Being Direct Distributor, They had some EXTREMELY high ratings, which was lovely; however, I believe that this was an incredibly irresponsible and wrong decision on their end to send a console labeled NEW as a poor refurb. However, Even though I missed the return date, on top of the fact they say you're not allowed to return game consoles, they gave me all my money back after being in limbo for a few days. Incredible experience overall, so I hate them and love them at the same time.The Console: I'm saying this from the perspective of my NEW One X from Microsoft. It's an AMAZING console, a significant upgrade as far as the 360 goes. It's so much different than my, so quiet, so powerful, and a dream to use.Right Now: Don't buy this Console, anywhere. It's far too expensive, it's dated hardware, and it offers an older design that in the 2017's is prone to overheating failure, don't bring me back to that issues on the 360. No good. However, I would go for the Series S, 300 dollars for Next-gen stuff? Or 12 Teraflops on the Series X for 63 dollars less than ""New"" asking on here right now? No thanks. Save yourself the money, and buy something even better. Thanks For Reading.Name: Jake O'MalleySeller: Direct Distributor

  I am a big Xbox fan and have owned every Microsoft Xbox since the original. In this generation I owned both the original Xbox one and now the Xbox one X. The Xbox one X is a big increase in processing power. I already have a large library of games and without having to purchase all new ones I am able to see huge benefits and experience greater immersion of my already favorite games.

  This Xbox One X was the first purchase to my ""4k upgrade"". I still need the TV but the Box works phenomenally. It loads and runs faster than my original Xbox One (I set two TVs up and ran them side by side with the same game). Highly recommend this Xbox but then again there is talks of a new console coming out that I am pretty excited for!

  Runs games faster, looks great. Mine seems to have something wrong with the ethernet port. If I have it plugged in,it will drop my connection about 5 minutes after powering on. It only drops for a second, but since basically every game is connecting to a server for something, it will usually kick me to the menu. I switched to wireless, and am not seeing that behavior any more. There's a work-around, but something this expensive shouldn't have that sort of issue, honestly

  I ordered a regular Xbox One X and got an Xbox One X NBA 2K 19 version with no NBA 2K 19. I would have thought about keeping it until I realized the box was open and the NBA 2K 19 redeem code had already been taken out. Which basically means the console is used or a refurb. Not what I expect from a product that is amazon fullifllied. Paying for a new Xbox One X and getting a used one. Unacceptable. Unacceptable. Unacceptable. It's great having to tell your kids on Christmas you have to return their most exciting gift............

  From the moment we got this xbox everything has been very laggy and crashing whenever we play a game. Then a few weeks ago the xbox wouldnt connect to the tv. We tried multiple hdmi chords and everything that Microsoft suggested. We finally took it to a repair shop and they said they wouldn't fix it because its a problem with a chip or mother board or something like that, and that the xbox 1 x has this happen to it all the time! So NEVER get this stupid console. Get a PS4 or something!

  (5/18/2020) I've been spending more time reading amazon reviews for electronics, and it seems like a lot of people are getting bad consoles (or maybe damaged during shipping, who knows...). Mine is a positive review because it's working perfectly. I've been able to do everything my old xbox could do and I haven't run into a single issue. I guess I got lucky...I didn't mind rolling the dice on this since amazon is pretty good about returns and it's not like this is a critical purchase. If it's a lemon and I have to return it and buy another one... it's fine. I got quarantine time.

  If you're a console gamer then this is the system you want for all your multiplatform titles, hands down. Native 4K gaming is truly a wonderful experience especially with the X Enhancement on many current and previous gen titles. Granted, we're only a year and a half out from the next generation of consoles. So if you would rather wait I would say do that, but if you're looking to ride out the final days of this gen with the best console possible. Look no further. Would be a 5 star rating, but the box came slightly bent, and I like to try and keep my boxes as pristine as possible.

  $499.99 for either a refurbished or used Xbox One X Console. It was discovered after registering the product with Microsoft online, warranty expires in just 40 days. Microsoft Customer Care Rep clarified that the warranty began on August 17 of 2019!If I wanted a used/refurbished console, I would have paid $399.99. Highly disappointed with the 3rd party seller, Amazon should take further action to prevent other sellers from blatantly mislead their customers.Buyer beware with this vendor, I should have read reviews before ordering this from Amazon.

  Games that take full advantage of 4K and HDR look unbelievable. Games that don't still boast visual improvements to varying degrees. On top of that, all games and apps load much faster than the original Xbox One. Games also hold more consistent frame rates. If you have a 4K tv, or plan on getting one in the near future, this is money well spent.

  Worked fine for a few weeks but now games are crashing and seems like hard drive is bad. Not able to return it because of the 30 day warranty. I didn’t notice it being a major problem until 2 months later. I was having small errors at first, closing out games but thought maybe it was a server issue. (Even though no one else playing was having a problem) Now it’s to the point the Xbox is shutting off itself and prompting me to factory reset. Never had an issue with any other Xbox and feel like the seller knew this was an issue beforehand. Makes sense it’s now discontinued.

  Yeah you can go buy a full gaming PC and get better graphics than changing your Xbox One.

  Tried it in 4k and 1080p. 1080p has clearly more sharp details and 4k is very cool. Either way it’s an upgrade. For 100 more than ps pro it’s worth the price diff for what you get.  There are also a lot of backward compatible less expensive to games. It’s cuuently the king and it’s only going to get better.

  I've been a Xbox user since they first came out in 2001. This XB1X is an outstanding value for $499. I think the first Xbox sold for $299 back in 2001. This latest generation is almost everything a user could hope for. MS finally got this right. My only hope was that it came in other colors. Black is not my favorite color in a gaming platform. The unit was easy to set up, almost plug and play. It is so quiet, one does not know it is on except for the white light on the front. Concerning the 4K, well I'm not sure if my eyes are sharp enough to distinguish the difference between 4K and 1080p but I'm glad it is build in as I have a Sony 4K TV connected to it. The XB1X will not make you a better player but if you are in the market to upgrade like I was then by all means give this a good looking over.

  I was so excited for this console, and originally thought it was better than the PS4. But it is buggy, having random graphical bugs on the main menu and struggling with backwards compatible games like Halo Reach. I got it so that I could play split screen with my friends on Halo, but I found out after I purchased the console that any players who want to play split screen together need to have Xbox Live Gold in order to play offline, which is absolutely unacceptable. I later traded it in for a Switch to play Zelda.

  Deserves nothing but 5 star reviews, worth every penny. Makes all my favorite games replayable again simply because of the graphical and resolution upgrades. Not to mention PUBG looks and runs 100x better! I have a 4k monitor but it's not HDR, so I'm missing out on one faze of this upgrade and I STILL recommend this!

  The sync button on the console did not work at all so I had to have a wired controller and couldnt use my wireless headset either. They also gave me a controller with a messed up right trigger button too. I called them and asked for a return label and they said they would send one and call me back and they havnt done it yet. I'm not gonna waste my time anymore so I'm gonna sell it myself. $300 down the drain because people cant test a product before they sell it.

  This product is amazing and a large noticeable difference between the original Xbox one. The graphics are insanely high quality if you have a 4K tv or monitor to go along with it or you won’t get the most out of this console.

  I've been an Xbox fanboy for years, so it was a no-brainer when they announced the Scorpio that I would be lining up to get one. As it was I ended up getting one about a month after release due to not having a 4K TV. I knew it wouldn't matter that much, but I figured if I was going to experience it the right way I might as well go all the way. Once I got the new 4K TV I knew it was time to order the Xbox One X.Let me tell you, watching 4K streaming from Amazon Instant Video or Netflix or 4K Blu-rays on the Xbox One X is so beautiful! Add in the fact that many games do have updated graphics to take advantage of the Xbox One X's improved power, including HDR, and gaming has taken on a whole new level. I don't believe the 4K gaming is the same jump up in graphics as 1080p was from standard def, but it is noticeable and worth every penny.If I have one complaint about the system, it's that it still freezes up on games from time to time. And every once in awhile you'll get stuttering in a game when too much is going on on the screen. That was one of the things that the Xbox One X was supposed to fix and not have happen as often, so hopefully now that the hardware is out there, new games that are made with the Xbox One X in mind will not have the problems that the current games with updated settings have.

  As a lifetime Playstation fanboy I have to admit, the X1X is amazing and has become my primary console... for third party games, which is basically all it can be since MS refuses to do anything about the absolute desert of first party games.If you can only own one console... get the Playstation Pro.  Image quality is almost as good as the X1X, plus you get all the amazing Playstation exclusive games.If you can own two consoles, the X1X is definitely where you'll want to play third party games (games available on both consoles) as the image quality is outstanding, the controller is much better, reduced load times and general snappiness is really noticeable and the interface is more enjoyable, though more cluttered than the PS4 interface.-1 star due to a dismal lack of exclusive games with absolutely nothing of interest on the horizon.

  The Xbox one x killed it. I have a Sony xbr900E 55 inch 4k TV with motion flow. When I turn picture settings to cinema pro and turn motion for to high/smooth I get the most wonderful experience with games. Just played the Witcher 3 in 4k and holy heavens this game is gorgeous and I own and have played it on PC and PS4. Nothing at this price range can achieve what this does. Hands down a beast of a system.

  I have two TVs in my front room that are used simultaneously for coop gaming. Currently I have a One S and the One X on either TV. There have been countless times where the One S will have frame rate studder where the One X will just keep on going smooth. There is no doubt in my mind the One X delivers a better gaming experience regardless if you have a 4k TV or not.

  The Xbox One x I got from Amazon was so unstable ... constant freezing up, multiple resets, interrupted downloads with Verizon FiOS gigabit download speeds, and wouldn’t update. Went to Microsoft Store and complained. They got me a new one, set it up, and did diagnostics to ensure new Xbox One x was stable. ALL problems disappeared. Playing COD WWII, Madden 18, Gears of War 4, Assassins Creed Origins, and all are beautiful in 4K HDR on OLED wallpaper TV 65” is stunning!! I hate the Windows 10 interface and so the OS for Xbox One x also stinks ... lacks linear coordination. Nicely included UHD Blu-Ray, but with 100GB games, need bigger HDD than 1TB. Also, playback in 12-bit color is nice touch. Seems like a lot of games now with Xbox One x patches with mixed results ... hope that gets better to unleash all that power!! Cool system now that it works.

  Had the white Xbox 360 and it worked for years till the red ring of death and then bought the 360 slim, Xbox One, and bought this Xbox One X a year and two weeks ago, and now I have to drop $250 to get it repaired. It starts to get slow and crashes all the time and right when the manufacturer warranty ends, boom, dead. Don't buy this, you're better off building a PC that's more expensive upfront but would last longer than this.

  This console is the true next gen console and the real deal.  My jaw hit the floor the first time I loaded up a game already in my xbox collection, gears of war 4, and instantly after downloading an enhancement patch a week earlier I was blown away about how clear, detailed, and significant the upgrade was. It's like having subpar vision and then getting glasses and 20/20 vision for the first time.  Everything looks clear, clean, vibrant, and a massive leap in resolution.  It has truly changed the gaming experience for me, i find myself blown away title after title, and the amount of an upgrade this wonderful super quiet systems provides.No video on the web or YouTube can ever do justice to have amazing it truly looks.  Best way to see the difference is to find a 2016/2017 Samsung or LG tv with YouTube that supports 4K and hdr and load the videos from digital foundry to see what it truly will look like when u play it for yourself.  Add to that an all in one entertainment system that the X also is, and throw in a 4K ultra hd blue ray player for $500, the value truly cannot be beat.  AMAZING, SUCH A GREAT VALUE BUY for what this system is capable of.

  Ok so, why a 5 star?  This thing is expensive.  Surely that is a 4 star item?  Well, you would be wrong.  After waiting a bit for some Xbox One X enhanced titles to drop, this thing is worth the price.  I've played the Following ...Gears of War 4Skyrim SEHalo 5Assassins Creed OriginsDestiny 2I know a lot of people don't think thats many, but they are all running if not at 4k, near 4k.  And with the additional effects of HDR.  It is pretty nice.  If you are a gamer and are into these types of things, this is where you want to be.

  I would give ZERO stars of possible. Ordered it said one day shopping, it arrived in 5 days so I finally turn on my Xbox and it just shows the black screen of death and the controller with it was also physically broken. I'm stuck inside another week during COVID-19 and have to wait for them to refund my order or give me a dang replacement.

  Says there are no problems but clearly the online services are unfixable. Gives two errors that cannot troubleshoot without developers. I took the xb1 and paid anyway, but for future buyers I'd like them to know what they're in for. Errors are ""Teredo"" and another one that involves DNS. I know it isn't my connection because I used 2 other copy consoles and they worked 100%.

  Completely unsatisfied with this product. I've had it a little more than a month and have had to do a complete factory reset on 3 occasions to correct E105 and E102 errors. The Xbox also drops internet connection several times an hour despite being hardwired in to my router. I have no problems with anything else connected in my house. I'm giving it one more chance and if it locks up again, sending it back for a refund and getting a PS4

  From faster load times, to games such as Battlefield 1 running at solid 60 fps, this console upgrade was well worth it. Being that Microsoft sold so many units of the X, game developers will look to utilize its power to maximize game performance for future titles. I play on a 1080p monitor and the difference in quality is noticeable even though a selling point is 4k gaming.

  
"

  Let me start by saying I have always owned all consoles (luckily my day job has allowed me the options): Nintendo, Sony and Microsoft, so I'm not particularly a fanboy of any one of them. At the start of this generation ""war"", I definitely favored the PS4. The stats and promised exclusives were more appealing to me than the XB1 at the outset, but I purchased the clunky-to-look-at, $500 XB1 anyway, including the required add-on and subsequently ill-fated Kinect alongside my PS4. It didn't get a whole lot of playtime, outside of the exclusives like Halo 5, Titanfall, and Gears and a few of the Live Gold freebies, and of course the FAR-superior video streaming service support/selection. But when the XB1X was announced and promised support for 4k gaming and 4k Blu-ray, my ears pricked up.This is the definitive home console experience right now if you have the display to take advantage of it. Gone are the huge external power supply and the hefty Kinect; this is pure, streamlined gaming power for the living room. The console runs very quiet (in fact, I don't think I've ever noticed noise out of it while playing a game). I have a late-2016 model (relatively) high-end 4K LG TV, and even that doesn't quite allow me to take full advantage of the HDR 4k capabilities. I can display in 4k resolution, but hit some roadblocks in the HDR department so this really is bleeding-edge technology for a gaming console. It looks great on my display, but it makes me want to splurge for something that takes full advantage.Bottom line: if you have a 4k display, this is the best you're going to get for multi-platform games (outside of a high-end gaming PC, which can run upwards of $2k, not including the cost of the 4k display), exclusives and 4k streaming services. AC Origins plays noticeably smoother on the 1X than the original XB1 and Shadows of War looks a lot better on the XB1X as well, to give a couple examples. If you have the means and the display, this is the console you should be playing on.

Most powerful console ever and a great bargain for what you get its actually a steal and a no Brainer to purchase for someone who appreciates high end graphics.I paid over 2000 for my pc last year and this console has similar performance.

  I bought this primarily with the intention of using it to play video games, but I've found myself using it quite a bit to stream 4k content from Netflix and watch 4k blu-ray discs.As a game console and an entertainment hub, it does phenomenal. I had an Xbox One prior to this and I'm really glad I upgraded, it was well worth the money. New games look absolutely stunning in 4k (Wolfenstein The New Collosus is a personal favorite) and older games play in a much higher framerate, at a better resolution, with drastically reduced loading times. Load times for games like ReCore took almost 3 minutes on my old Xbox One; now on my Xbox One X it is about 20 seconds or less.Beautiful, compact system with an excess of power and a 4k Blu-ray player built in. I couldn't be happier. 10/10 recommend this system. (Goes without saying, to get the most out of this system you should have a quality 4k TV connected to it).

  I so badly wanted the Scorpio edition. But like major Nelson said once  they are gone they’re gone… But that wasn’t the case... I initially pre-ordered the regular Xbox one x but on day of the the release the Scorpio edition was back in stock to magically. I promptly returned my standard eddition and re-ordered the Scorpio edition. I know it’s the same thing but I’ve been a big fan of the Xbox for years and followed the release of the new system from when they originally announced at  E3 the year before. In addition to the special finish it also comes with a free vertical stand  that I would’ve bought for $20-$30 anyway.  The side has a nice gradient finish that goes from black to gray with a Scorpion like texture to accompany the change in color. The controller and console both have project scorpio written on it in bright Xbox green. Came with a free Xbox live trail and a a trial for the new Xbox game pass which is awesome 100+ games plus new exclusives instantly! Now the actual system! Oh boy is it quick! Load times are crazy fast compared to the OG xb1. 1tb was less than I’d hoped but what I expected. Wished it had of been a solid state drive like the elite I have but most my games are on externals anyway which are faster. I love that they give you the option for 4K or a performance mode that ups the frame rate. Which is clutch because I thinks frames are king 60fps>4K anyday. Which makes it a great option for ppl who don’t own a 4K tv just yet. So this system has room to grow as 4K TVs become cheaper. Also offers active sync that smooshes jitter for a buttery smooth playback. HDR is also included as is Dolby Atmos. Which are both hidden gems. Atmos Sound and hdr color will make you look at games in a new way. Like how did I do without this all my life!?!? Makes games super cinematic. All and all I am very happy with my purchase and can’t wait to see what video game developers will do with this beast of a machine. Now we wait and enjoy!

  This xbox is one of the fastest consoles I have ever bought, truly amazing. I was not expecting to get the Xbox One X Fallen Order bundle as amazon only displayed the regular xbox one x, which is even better! I haven't tried the 4k resolution but I can already tell its going to be breath taking. Overall, very pleased!

  I'm not going to describe it because many people already did it, but let me tell you some extra information:* If you want to use Xbox360 games review the list at Xbox website, not all of them are enabled.  For the ones that work (like Call of Duty Advanced Warfare) they run perfect, no issues at all.* Yes, it's 110v-240v (autoswitch).  You don't need a transformer for 220v (in fact I'm using it in this way)* It brings 1 wireless controller only (I had to return it to Microsoft because it had random disconnections). You have to raise a case through Xbox support (you have to logon with your MS account, the same one you use in the Xbox)* Check the warranty date at Xbox website (it's 1 year manufacturer's warranty). I had to claim for it because it appeared as I had only 6 months of warranty.* Warranty for accesories (like controllers) is 90 days* Don't forget to register your Xbox, you cannot raise any tickets if it's not registeredHope you find this information useful

  Xbox One X is truly powerful and heavy too. Don't lift it with one hand you might hurt your wrist its amazing how Microsoft manage to put all that component inside such a small body. The Xbox One X UI is finally fast and fluent before with the Xbox One and Xbox One S UI was so sluggish and sometimes unresponsive now everything loads up quick like the thumbnails from Xbox Store all data reads faster now including steaming, uploading and downloading (Even in 4K). The Xbox One X makes your classic Original Xbox and Xbox 360 games look better then ever the textures are more crisp anti-aliasing is great no more edgy lines. Not every game is 4K, but it has more support from developers to put native 4K/HDR with 30 FPS and 1080p/HDR with 60 FPS then PS4 Pro. When it comes to third party games Xbox One X is the way to go.Xbox One X is a must buy, but the bad news is there is no exclusives for Xbox One X so if you own a high end gaming PC with a GTX 1080 your wasting money on something that has the same games you can play on PC technically you are not missing anything. When it comes to consoles I suggest PS4 Pro and Switch, plus a high end gaming PC with this you are not missing anything. Xbox One X is target for people that have no time and money to build a gaming PC like me PC gaming is super expensive...>_<Overall Xbox One X is the best alternative for a gaming PC its powerful, fast and cheap....o(^-^)o

  First off, I’m a huge PC gamer and this console is as close as you can get to having a 4K ready gaming machine without spending $1500+ to barely tap 60FPS in 4K. Everything looks so beautiful and detailed, games load very quickly compared to other consoles. The upscaling of older games is so noticeable even when using it on a 1080P TV. The only thing I hated is the fact that I specifically got this console through Amazon because I didn’t want to stand in line to get one. Also, this was the only reason I applied for the Amazon Prime card as well. I didn’t receive the console for 2 days. After reading several forums, Amazon is notorious for this issue “Delay in Shipping” when it comes to new consoles. I will never pre-order anything and recommend you just go wait in line. At least you’ll have it same day.Note: there is an update of about 778MB when you first hook it up, so be ready for that.

  It’s a solid console.  I’m upgrading from a one S.  I had it for 4 days before it died.  TV said no signal.  Call Microsoft support and they couldn’t fix it.  I was told I needed to send it to service and it could be up to 2 weeks before I’d get it back.  Awesome!  (Sarcasm).  Instead I contacted amazon and they had a new one to me next day.  And just asked to put the old one in the box and send it back.  So my review is actually for Microsoft and they’re crap customer service as opposed to their product.  After a google search I learned my no signal problem isn’t too uncommon either.  Soooooo.  That’s not good.

  The Xbox One X is amazing. It is so much better than I expected. 4k with HDR gaming is the future even old games like Gears of War 4 and Halo 5 feel like new experiences due to how powerful the X is.All games run better, all games look better and games even have faster loading times. The X is so impressive of a console and worth every dollar. Would highly recommend.What is probably most impressive is that you don't need a 4k TV to get the benefits. It even looks better on the 1080p TV in the living room! However to get the most out of the console, I do recommend having a 4k TV which you can pick up for a very reasonable price right now.

  Really makes a difference on Forza Motorsport 7 and Forza Horizon 3. If you plan to install more than a couple of 4K games, get an external USB 3.0/3.1 drive. 4K games take up a lot of space. A good external drive will load just as fast or faster than the internal. It would almost make sense for Microsoft to sell these with a smaller drive installed, but smaller than 1TB isn't cheaper anyway. I also have a second external drive attached to save game clips. You can record a clip up to one hour long clips with an external drive. It requires separate drives for each purpose, storage and media. For storage, let the XBox One format it. For media, format it as NTFS using a PC. Once a game is installed on the external drive, it can be played on any other XBox One. All video formats will be available, whatever the machine supports. It makes a decent heater for a small room also.

  A Birthday gift purchased for a youngling who’s 3 year old Xbox One just up and turned into a paperweight.Repair estimates were within 2/3 the cost of a new one so we all splurged for his BD gift.The new one didn’t seem to get as hot as the old one. And I noticed it lost the massive power converter. Otherwise I can’t say how much better it is than the old one.  Most of what I remember of the games we play together when I visit they looked about the same.He does tell all of us that new games and movies and streaming movies have a much clearer picture. So I’ll take his word for it.Although I’m still a little curios how the old one can work fine, be turned off, then never turn on correctly again...

  Awesome console for high quality home theaters, but with huge updates to download.  I have all the consoles, used to be a PC game, and actually already owned a XBOX ONE.  I purchased this as an entry into 4k.  My primary gaming setup is a basement home theater a 1080 projector, 4k projectors are still way to expensive, but I was willing to buy a 4k TV for the living room.  I purchased the XB1X console in conjunction with a 65 inch Sony 4k HDR capable television.  This console is also plugged into a high quality receiver and speaker system.  I have 6 games that are enhanced for the console and they are really amazing in action.  You can't appreciate the improvement until you see it live in 4k with HDR, any online video in 1080 is not going to do it justice..  Forza 7 and Rise of the Tomb Raider are stand outs.  There is a very big difference between streaming 4k signals via netflix or youtube and a native 4k game or 4k blu ray disc.  Until this console was available I did not see a good reason to take the plunge.  If you want a next level experience and have the cash to burn it is a fun ride once the games are installed.This console exists side by side with the XB1 which is designed to run games in regular HD, so whenever you install a new game it has to download all the improved 4k textures and assets from the internet.  This can be significant, for example in the case of Forza 7, the update was 62GB.  Gone are the days when you can insert a game and just play, every one of the enhanced games I have played required a pretty significant update.  My internet speed is 100Mbs, some of these updates basically needed most of the a night to download.  The downloads will continue when your console is on stand by, so you pop the game in, get the download going and walk away.  You can't just pop a disc in and play.  This may not always be the case, it is possible future releases could include the 4k assets on disc, but for now it is the reality.I am curious to see how this console evolves in the future.  During the run up to release a lot was made of its VR capabilities, but MS has gone silent on that.  I don't know if there is a pending announcement, but it is something I will like to try out, so hopefully it comes back.  There is also an opportunity to push this console beyond what could be supported by the regular XB1 console, so I am not sure how that will play out.  Will there be a new XB console released when the Playstation 5 comes out?  There are certainly some open questions regarding the future.  In the meantime if you want the best experience outside of a custom PC gaming rig, the XB1X is the best available option right now.  If you have a great display and sound system, you finally have a simple device that can pump native 4k content through your system.

  It’s super fast and it’s the new lastest and greatest. I bought this to upgrade my day one release Xbox one. This Xbox is smaller but heavier than the old Xbox. Speeds are crazy fast, here is the thing tho. I don’t have a 4K tv but will in the future, and bought this system knowing that. But if you don’t have a 4K or plan on buying a 4K then stick with the Xbox S. Most people will not see a difference on a non 4K tv. If your not planning to upgrade the tv then save you money.  If you have or planning to get a 4K, then go for it, this thing has crazy graphics. Hope this helps

  Figured it was time for an upgrade considering my first gen xbox one(day one) was starting to really run games slower than ever, disc drive was not wanting to give games back, etc. Worth the money. My buddies and I have been on xbox live for 8+ years, this is by far the best xbox system I've used, runs fast, displays beautifully on a 4k tv.If you're looking to buy an xbox or playstaton for the first time, take it from someone who has been using both the last 10+ years(90% of that time on an xbox, though I've owned all gens of playstation), go with the playstation for game options/exclusives alone. PSN has given me really cool classic titles for free, and has many cheap for purchase(old final fantasy games, jak and daxter games, etc.). Xbox Live has given me Killer instinct, among other incredibly forgettable games. Would you rather play a new Halo, or Bloodborne 2? Sea of Theives, or The Last Of Us 2? Exactly.If you're like me and already have way too much invested into xbox live, all your friends play xbox live, all your games are on there, whatever it is, then this is truly a beast of a game console and the smoothest running xbox, or game console to date.Pros:Truly looks great with a 4k setup.Much slimmer/sleeker than the original design.Physical power button, not touch.USB port is front facing this time.More storage if you dont have an external hard drive.Backwards compatibility is awesome. Cool I can still play Half Life 2.Destroys games, the witcher 3 and battlefield 1 run smoother/look better than ever.Cons:The price. I mean, you could buy a lot of snacks and beer with $500.Xbox Live instead of Playstation Network, if you've used both, PSN is a better service, Sony gets much better exclusives/indies imo.Overall:5 stars because it's not the console's fault that I'm salty about my friends and I not deciding to get ps3's instead of 360's back in late 2006.The Xbox One X is undoubtedly the most capable, powerful gaming console on the market, and it proves this with it's game performance.

  Less visual improvement over Xbox One S than expected. Playing assassins creed origins on the One S and now on the One X doesnt show a huge differnace on an LG OLED 4K. I still recommend the console. However, a one S combined with an existing 4K is already 90+ percent of the clarity you’ll get when you upgrade.

  Love the picture on my 4k tv.  The system interface is snappy if a little cluttered.  Mostly play Madden and Rocket League and am waiting for high quality exclusives.  I have a pretty beefy gaming PC but I used my Xbox 360 for most multi-player games.  Hoping the Xbox One X brings more of those soon.

  What a beautiful console. I have ran tests in a few games. From backward compatible games to recent released games to some pretty ages games. All on the enhancement settings not in 4K setting but it won’t make a difference to be honest. For a game like The division this game is a beauty. On the Xbox one X  I have done load time tests and saw that the loading times have increased 2-3 times faster then the original Xbox one from 2013. From being 26-30 seconds on the original between each and every load to 12-19 seconds on the Xbox one X which varies depending what you are doing ( in the main menu when entering into the game is the longest times while fast traveling is the shorter times ). This also speaks for a game like mass effect andromeda which if you original Xbox one player should ever played the load times on the main menu to the doors when your traveling around takes forever to open or load up but with the Xbox one x the load times are such a significant increase in load times. When walking around the ship in mass effect andromeda the doors usually open before you even step near it orrrr it will open instantly when next to the door which in the original Xbox one it was so tedious to wait for those freakin doors to load up and open so you can enter the next room. And when your game loads up on the main menu ? I would say it’s close to being cut in half. In games like borderlands 2 and the pre sequel I never tested it on the original Xbox one but I’ve entered the game through the main menu and it took literally about 6-7 seconds. Fast traveling for some reason was 9-10 but that is deff fast ! In CPU heavy Games or even just very tough performing Games the Xbox one X dominates the market by cutting the load times by almost half of not half compared to the PlayStation pro which is quite insane. And that’s after the patch the Bethesda brought to the console. Before it was even faster. Over all in all my games I have seen significant improvements whether it’s framerate or even load times and in game quality. And that’s with the including 1 TB hard drive ? Amazing. On the new game pubg this thing is a beauty. Now it’s does almost locked 30fps in 4K which for pubg is completely unbelievable for a 500$ piece of technology. No crashes, little rubber banding in the beginning of games everybody now and then and such smooth gameplay compared to the original Xbox one and even the one S. All games will be improved in such significant ways compared to the one S and the original Xbox one. I have 13 games installed right now. Borderlands the pre sequel, call of duty black ops 3, call of duty infinite warfare, fallout 3, fallout 4 ( including the far harbor and nuka world dlc downloaded ), forza Motorsport 7 demo, halo 5, L.A noire, mass effect andromeda, pubg, record definitive edition, skate 3 and, Tom Clancy’s the division and have 315.3 GB of storage left. And this is with all the patches installed for the 4K/enhancements. The only downside in my opinion would be the fact that when setting up the console for something reason it takes about 280 GB away for idk what reason so you actually start off with 720 GB or so I believe I started with 718 to Ben exact. But honestly it’s worth 500$. No and I mean no other piece of gaming and video streaming tech can compare to a console like this. The enhancements and improvements with this compared to the PlayStation 4 pro is literally night and day. And a 500$ pc cannot compare this thing blows it out of the water. I haven’t also experience any issues at all it’s the best experience. Also you will be saving a lot of space cause this thing is literally small as hell ! The thing that’s blew me away also is the fact that this thing isn’t such a powerful console with some top notch tech yet it’s almost soundless. It’s really quite ! It’s deff worth it for 500$. I really hope everyone could get this to experience true top notch gaming and fun.

  I'm not really a fan of XBOX and I only bought it because my husband loves them, but I must say I'm really enjoying having it. The system is super fast, small and lightweight and i love the 1tb space, but the best thing ever is the Xbox game pass (20us a month for access to free games, how awesome is that) Ok I will admit, albeit a little grudgingly, it is a pretty awesome system.

  The XBOX ONE X is a great product, and I am happy that I upgraded from an older XBOX ONE. It runs smoothly, quietly, plays 4K Blu-Ray, etc., supports HDR, but what I have found so unexpectedly great about it is that it plays Amazon Videos flawlessly and much better than even an Amazon Firestick. When developers can take full advantage of its capabilities it will be the console to have.

  Xbox One X is the best console out there. I wanted to see it with my eyes so I bought it and it never disappointed. I use it on my Full HD TV and it upscales the picture quality to look like it's 4K.Game loading is really fast. Playing FIFA 18, I notice the time between when you wait to start a match and when you press the Menu button to start the game is really fast compared to other consoles.The controller feels really good on the hand and feels premium IMHO.Updates just makes the game better.

  I love my Xbox One X. For me, it's a definite upgrade from the regular Xbox One. Pair it with 4K TV and the you'll experience a much richer, cleaner, faster and a smooth-enhanced picture . I started FO4 on it for the first time and what a difference this console made. To me it's like a whole new game. As well, it is much smaller. Crazy that the size of it, does so much... and it's quiet!Is it worth the money, you might ask? I think so. In terms of connection issues, lag, overheating, startup and/or crashing - I've experienced no problems at all. I bought it just last month and put some serious hours of gaming on it already. Other than gaming, I've played movies, watched videos on it and, still it runs like new. So I figure if its going to break, it should of buy now.Overall, it makes my games (old and new) a lot more enjoyable. Demo one today!

  Nice surprise! This review consist of 3 4k games and UHD streaming movies. When playing Guardians of the Galaxy, the colors seem to look better IMO. A nice smooth texture to gold and reds  I connect everything through a Sony Z series receiver, due to Dolby Atmos set up.  I would love to see this on an OLED T.V.  I use a Sony 930 E.  Make sure you download the Dolby Atmos app.  Anything 4k you will see the enhanced graphical power compared to an S series, especially games like Halo 5.  A small update and you are off to 4k pvp.  I also played  Kong Skull Island.  My S with Atmos,  would give you chills.  Now with the X the picture is as good as the sound.  Way better than spending money at movies, unless you are going for the experience.  Remember to save  your games on a hard drive.

  Microsoft’s New console is a beast! With a very powerful and well thought out console. I had the first generation Xbox one and that thing is louder runs hotter and now a papper weight, after getting the X. I run a Samsung 50” UHD TV with a Highspeed HDMI(comes in box) and a Sat6(10GBS) hardwire to my router with a bypassed and portforwarded though the fire wall. The X I believe has a Sat4,5 so with 10GBs a sexy WiFi (ATT U-verse fiber optic) I am hitting a slow dowload of 350MBS with a High of 600MB/s (Open bandwidth) Now This may varey apon internet provider and what they offer, but I wanted to put it my review to show the upgrade of the last gen witch for me only hit a of 150mbs. So in all my x does 1GB every 2 seconds and a 48GB game in 96 seconds or 1min 36sec.Now for the UHD output 4K is made in difrent ways 1080 in a cross grid then upscaled and 4K output. The Xbox does the 4K UHD output(True 4K) With my tv Running 10 Bit 32collor pallet. So that’s 32 colors put into a single pixel and 4K is 4096x2160 next to a HD (1080) 1920x1080. The console puts out 283,115,520 colors 60times a second. Your brain can see at around 25 FPS(Frames per sec) and drops below look like screen tears and slow mo. Now The one is a True gamers dream console and would only be available with a mid level gameing PC with a $700 price tag. Now the XBOX has a $509 MSRP After taxes.(Texas order). So it is the best bang for the buck! It does have a solid state drive a WD 1TB(1000GB) witch could have been swaped for a SSD during production for faster download speed hence the high of a 300mbS with a sat 5 capable of 7GBS a sec. Wich isn’t bad at all but I am nit picky and my only gripe.But In all a stock a Gameing rig you pay $500 for and well worth $200 more.  Not only loads faster a Higher 16GB ram for visible data and I game meshes to not have to load the worlds as much. A plug in and play with internal power brick a multi media player SD, Blue Ray, and UHD4k DVD. And enginuity that blows Sony out of the water like Hiroshima, and grafics that suck you in and makes the game seem feel and look amazing!

  I upgraded to this from my original Xbox One.  After a couple of days playing on it I am truly impressed.  I tested my enhanced Gears of War 4 on my Samsung 4K HDR TV.  I was mesmerized  by the detail and the colors, so much so I kept getting killed.  It may take a while to adjust to this hypotonic effect.  I then went back to playing my half completed unenhanced Half Life 2 360 game and found that even this game looked and played smoother.  Start up times are a lot quicker, but enhanced games are slower due to more data.  You will soon need an external hard drive due to large file sizes.  Fortunately, I already had a 2TB drive.

  First let me say I love the Xbox one x, I have been an Xbox fan from the beginning. I ordered the Xbox one x because I wanted to upgrade to 4k. I purchased a new Yamaha 4k Receiver and 82"" 4k TV. I received my Xbox and everything went smooth and loved the picture and gaming. Here is why I am only rating it 3 stars. Does Microsoft think people are going to spend thousands of dollars on 4k equipment only to play games? I just upgraded my DirecTV to 4k and the designers of the Xbox one x had no concept of anyone needing 4k pass through. So now the functionality I have come to love with the Xbox one and one x does not work. I cannot run my DirecTV receiver through the Xbox anymore, one of the features I loved, want to go from watching a tv show to playing Xbox, just turn on the controller log in and play, not any more. If I would have known this I would not have bought this as all the games I play now are 1080 at most anyway since I now have to run the DirecTv through my receiver and switch back and forth from Xbox, it makes all the integrated TV options a waste of functionality. Very disappointing that the designers wouldn't take into account if someone wants 4k they will want it in everything they do which includes TV.

Super glad I was able to get one for $430! Saved over $100 compared to buying a new version of the system, the 4k output is incredible, seeing Master Chief (Halo 5: Guardians) run in 4k feels weird at first but you get used to the visuals! Can't wait to play games like Crackdown 3 and Red Dead Redemption 2 in 4k when those games come out!

  I am not entirely a “graphics whore”, as I play games on 3DS and really enjoyed the WiiU. However, I do appreciate great graphics when I can get them. And the Xbox One X will give you great graphics. Aside from having a top end PC, it doesn’t get better. If you have a 4K HDR TV you will be impressed.

  I switched this from ps4 because of the 4k gaming.  I was considering getting a PS4 pro but I am glad I got this instead.  The console is super quiet compared to my ps4 and I like the menus/interface better.  In regards to hardware, Sony has been beaten by microsoft.  However, Sony has the best exclusives which I will still play on my ps4, but for games that come out on both consoles, I will be getting them for the xbox from now on.

  Upgraded from an original Xbox One Forza Edition and wow is this new One X so much faster loading. The 4k ability is very nice in the games that make use of it, currently not too many do but that list will only grow. I really like the size compared to the original one too, even with an internal power supply the unit is MUCH smaller. I will say that the One X is fairly loud with the cooling fans going, generally not an issue during game play but noticeable when there isn't much going on like picking out a netflix movie to watch or going through the main menus.

  If you have an Xbox one, this seems to run/load your games twice as fast, Microsoft is the top game console maker, hands down for a reason. They smoke the unbelievably built PS4, & I’m a true Sony fan (TVs, & their other electronics). But while Sony gives away for free their version of what Microsoft charges you $59.99 a year for & most people I know pay up, why?  Cause it’s that good.

  This is a tough call. On one hand many games dont render full textures. But on the other hand it's a solid 4k experience in terms of pixeldepth. Also I had many issues within the first week.

  After reading reviews about problems and glitches, I was all but ready to pass on this system. However, I did my homework and really wanted the chance to experience it myself.  I purchased the Sony 65"" 930E TV and the Yamaha A770 receiver. The only thing missing was the Xbox One X. I played for a week on my Xbox One and was really enjoying the crisp, bright graphics, saving my eye-sight. Then I made the decision and added the Xbox One X. Wow, it does make a worthy difference. The same games I was playing before look perfect. Forza Horizon 3 and Wolfenstein II don't have any upgraded 4k patches, to my knowledge. However they look so much better and run so smoothly. I have not experienced any glitches either. Turn in 4k HDR, in your TV's HDMI settings, then turn on 4k on the Xbox One X.Easy as that, looks great, runs great, and the cooling has been whisper quiet. Money well spent.

  I'm now satisfied for 5 years with my home entertainment section. PC is getting some bumps, though, as usual. Switch is also quite persuading, and you know Sony has been there forever, so where you gonna go? It's up to you, but there are a few exclusives that are going to be worth the wait (do your own research). I've been a fan since the 360 and I don't see myself changing unless Playstation makes Tribes with better graphics. Good day people

  Glitchy glitchy glitchy... I sent this back and decided to keep using my Xbox One S instead, at-least it works. Rather just use my PC for 4K because at-least it is stable.Wifi drops all the time too, doesn't happen with any of the 10-15 other devices I have that use my wifi so it is not my router. (Tested with my router and the built in wifi that comes with my Xfinity cable box).Graphics are great if you don't mind being disconnected all the time and to make it even worse, you get kicked out of single player games when you get disconnected?! What kind of idiot thought that would be a great feature to add?!

  I love my Xbox One X. It is a fantastic games machine that makes a great companion for a 4k HDR television. Titles like Forza 7, Super Lucky's Tale, Final Fantasy XV and many other games look breath-taking in 4K. This is the real deal! The console is quiet too! It does get fairly toasty, however, so make sure you give it plenty of room to breathe. Well worth the price of admission. Great hardware, great games, what's not to like?!

  A very impressive piece of hardware! The power in the box is apparent as soon as you boot it up. The several games I have played so far (AC: Origins, Middle-Earth: Shadow of War, Battlefield 1, and Bioshock: Infinite) look absolutely stunning! Seeing pictures and watching videos on the internet of what this console can do serve it no justice.. you seriously need to see it with your own eyes! There is a lot of untapped potential in this console for gaming, but that will fall squarely on the developers shoulders, and since Microsoft's first-party AAA titles have been lacking this year there are only a handful of titles that truly take advantage of the hardware. But, that will change and continue to grow into 2018 and beyond.

  A very great and powerful that plays all my games better. I hope Microsoft comes out with some better exclusive games that take advantage of the X. The X also needs more enhanced games to play. There are not a ton of enhanced games to play on the X. The enhanced games look amazing in a 1080p scene. The supersampling for the X works great. The X needs more USB port. I don't know why they took away the ports in the back of it. If you're planning to play a lot of games on it, buy an extra hard drive because, with about 8 games, the 1TB will be almost done.

  Not a significantly noticeable difference in speed. When I turned it on expected apps and games to load much faster. But it's only a few seconds.There's also a new brief startup animation  before the standard Xbox screen pops up and it happens every time you start up the system.The upscaling is great, but most games don't have enough of a graphical benefit to justify the purchase.Most games have the same locked framerate and even though you load in games faster most people don't have the X so you still have to wait for others to join in anyway.Not really worth it if you have the original or the S.Most multi-player games also restrict a lot of the benefits of the X in order to maintain a even level of competition.You also have to re download every game you have and sign in to every app.

  Had so many issues from the start. Would not always sign you in or would not connect to Xbox live.  My original Xbox One worked fine.  This one was hooked directly to router.  Spoke with Microsoft techs and performed all their steps to no avail.  Very disappointing.  Getting new one sent out.  Hopefully next one will be better.=====================================================UPDATE.......Replacement Xbox One X arrived and exact same issues.  Finally found a way to fix it ""sort of"".  Turn the auto-sign in option off.  Including the controller sign in option.  While you have to click the Xbox button and sign in each time it does not give any issues.  As stated earlier I had non-stop issues with it not signing in my account or Xbox live even though I had internet connected.  Since I disabled that I have had no further issues.  If you do another thing to do as well is when you shut it off go to your settings and select the option to completely shut down.  I have not had to do that but its an option if you have more issues than me.  I hope Microsoft fixes this glitch soon, with the cost of this system it is rather frustrating.  One other thing, this may have been a fluke but wanted to mention just in case.  During a game I did get disconnect from my account mid-game.  Only happened once and signed back in right away but just wanted to put that out there for everyone.  Be sure to vote helpful if this helped you.  I'll keep updating if anything else comes up.

I wish they would bring back the Fitness app from Sumo digital! It was the very best use of the Kinect - truly amazing and effective.  The ability to get instant feedback on form and performance was astounding and inspirational - I would gladly pay for even a simple version of that app.  Part of the reason I chose XBOX again was to have specifically the Fitness APP.  Just 3 basic workouts with 3 fitness levels would sustain my interest for a year and I would pay $49.99 for the privilege.  Who's with me?

  Let me start off by saying that I am an Xbox fanboy but man do I have a love/hate relationship with Microsoft.The good: When paired with a 4K tv, this gem delivers!!!! When playing Xbox one X enchanced games on this beast, it will set the standard for your taste in graphics moving forward. Example, Gears of war 4 on this was literally jaw dropping! I played through the game not even giving a damn about the story. The game world alone was just so rich, vibrant, and finely detailed on this console!The bad: We all know Microsoft has an exclusive problem but coming from a PS4....it’s night and day how HUGE this problem is. There are literally a handful of GOOD games that really take advantage of this consoles graphics and once you have played all of them, you are just sitting there like....”so ahhhh....when’s the next ‘exclusive’ coming out.”Brutally honest: This console is a gem when played with games that are made specifically for it, like the new Forza, but once you’ve played them all your left wondering whether you should have waited until after E3 2018 to see if they will fix their exclusive problem or not.My advice...kills me to say it...PS4 pro will give you more bang for your buck. Unless you have money laying around, wait until after E3 2018 to see if this console is really worth it. Now if you have never had an Xbox one then yea..obviously get the best version possible to ride out this console generation but if you already have one and thinking about upgrading...wait until the price goes down and more enchanced games come out mate.

  I bought the xbox one x thinking that I would see an amazing difference in gameplay. I was mistaken. I have an xbox one s and I saw no preformance difference. It took really long for the initial boot up and the controller that came with it did not even connect to the console, even though I tried clicking the connection buttons at the same time. It connects for a second then cuts off. Honestly if I were to rethink my decision. The only reason why I'm not returning it to get my money back is that I still have faith. Maybe there are other games that will play in true 4k 60. I bought it new and I liked the new console and everything. I'll sell the controller and get a different one.  If you do not have a 4k tv, IT IS NOT WORTH IT.

  I load in before anyone in Call of duty and most games. Load screens are so fast and 4K with 60 frames is wonderful. It’s a powerful upgrade that gamers will appreciate. Cost might be the only thing that I can say bad about it. But it’s a fair price for what it can do. If you have an Xbox one, it’s a great upgrade. I wouldn’t if I had a Xbox one S.

  Bought two of them for 469usd on a great seller offer listed. The graphics are amazing on Hitman, FIFA18 and COD. Played Hitman and the Highframe rate settings is amazing, feels nice playing on 60fps. The only downside is the Bluray 4K! What happened to Microsoft? Bought Planet Earth II 4k and the quality is not that great! looks blurry compared to some Samsung 4k demos I downloaded to an usb. The great thing is the HDR colors, I still prefer buying my own Bluray player!

  Upgrades to the gaming and video abilities are great. Can’t wait for dolby vision support as this is one of the few devices that already supports Netflix atmos. I’m sure more content that takes advantage of the extra power will continue to come out as more users start to migrate. Only downside is the lack of Bluetooth support - even with 3rd party adapters.

  I use to have frame rate lag in certain games with my Xbox One, but that is no longer an issue with the One X - The speed of this console, along with the brilliant colors and clarity at 4k resolution are breathtaking - People that wan to compare Xbox to Playstation really don't understand game consoles, because it really boils down to which exclusive game titles you like more - When it comes to power, the Xbox One X is the most powerful console ever built

  I’ve only had my Xbox one X for 3 days and I’m loving it so far. I can definitely see improvements in my games whether there 4k compatible or 1080p, even Xbox 360 titles get visual and performance improvements. Only games I have that’s Xbox one X enhanced right now is Gears of war 4 and Final Fantasy XV and I cant wait to get more games later. My only complaint is the 1tb hard drive, doesn’t seem like it’s enough space considering most 4k games are 80-100gb large so you will definitely fill up that space quickly with just a few games. You will be ok if you buy a cheap external hard drive. I would definitely recommend buying the Xbox one X if you have a 4k hdr tv and even if you don’t 1080p content will benefit from the one X with upscaling and super sampling. The X still doesn’t compare to a PC but it’s the closest in terms of power.

  The Xbox One X is much slimmer and I love that it no longer comes with a brick for an A/C converter. So far no huge differences in gameplay, even when supposedly in 4 K. The controller does not come with a charger or wire. In wireless mode, it often disconnects from the console. I would recommend waiting until the price drops below $200 before buying one. It really is not that different from the S in practical terms.

  I've been using my X since November when it came out. And I've been putting up with its lock ups and reboots until today. I finally had enough and sent it for repair. My Xbox One S is taking its place. It's somewhat slower in some gaming aspects but at least it's more reliable.I have no experience with Play Station but I will give it a try when a new one comes out.Xbox is not something I recommend.

  Very happy with this product Xbox has never let us down. Only one problem it does not come with a adapter to hook up your Kinect and they no longer sell them kind of disappointing. Because they don't sell them anymore people are selling them on eBay for an inflated amount of money. A friend of ours gave us the Kinect version that you hook up to your PC and it had an adapter in it. But if you don't have a Kinect you don't have a problem.

  I've been an Xbox fan since 2002 and I am proud to own an Xbox One X. I bought the original Xbox One at launch and I was stoked when they announced the X! I am currently playing this on my 55"" Samsung 1080p tv. I'm saving up to get a Samsung 4k Q7. I've been playing Middle Earth:Shadow of War and it looks amazing with the Quality option activated. It takes the 4k resolution and turns it into a 1080p resolution with better textures and greater draw distances. I was surprised and very impressed with how much of a difference it made from playing it on my original Xbox One to playing it on the Xbox One X! There is also an option to have a better resolution in Shadow of war,I played around with the 2 settings and the Quality option was ultimately the better of the 2. I also played Wolfenstien 2 with the Xbox One X enhancement on and it was pretty awesome,especially the cutsceens! I can't wait to see what games look like on my Samsung 4k TV when I get it! I never finished Fallout 4,but I definitely will when I get my 4k tv! Games load a lot faster on the Xbox One X,it's very impressive and I am glad I decided to get one even though I don't have a 4k tv. The Xbox One X is definitely worth the $500 considering that's how much the original Xbox One was at launch in 2013!

  Literally the fastest console to date.

Menu is snappy. Load times are FAST. $500 price tag is steep however, especially for something that was released with no REAL exclusive titles.

  As an owner of a PC with SLI GTX 1080 Ti, I have no difficulty in saying this Xbox hands down provides the best living room experience. Nothing comes close. 4K streaming, 4K Blu Ray, 4K high end PC quality gaming in the living room.The only complaint I see people have is with the price tag. Honestly, I find that ridiculous as $500 is a steal for how powerful this box is. You'd need a PC where the graphics card alone is $400-$500 to run games like the Xbox One X does. You absolutely get more than you pay for out of this console if you care at all about the visual fidelity of your living room games.To summarize, I have nothing but positive things to say about the new Xbox. The build quality is superb, the box is whisper silent, and the box is rock solid stable. Xbox 360 and Xbox OG backwards compatibility. All Xbox One games(including non enhanced ones) run noticeably better on this- they don't drop frames where the old Xbox would and games with a variable resolution stay locked at the highest resolution. 4 free games per month that you get to keep forever simply by having Xbox Live. Get yourself a huge external hard drive and you're good to go.

  I've been an Xbox junkie since the original Halo was released in 2001. Since that time I've never owned another console--unless you count the Switch, but that's my daughters. Nonetheless, this thing is beast! It's like an Xbox had sex with a computer and this is their offspring. Don't listen to those ninny PlayStation fanboys touting how much better the PlayStation is--the Xbox One X blows that pile of hot garbage out of the water (toilet water). For those that nitpick every single negative thing, let me be very clear...EVERY console has something wrong with it. In fact, everything has something wrong with it if you look hard enough. I could probably find something wrong with the fork that I'm going to be using later tonight to eat my dinner. My advice to you--stop complaining and just enjoy it!In all seriousness, I was extremely skeptical before purchasing this. I honestly didn't think there would be a major improvement with the games--visually speaking. I mostly wanted to get the One X for it's smaller form factor, built in power supply, and rear venting. To my surprise, I immediately noticed the graphical improvement with the One X enhanced games. I'm not exactly sure how to explain it other than to say it just looks amazing. The detail is crystal clear, the colors are more vibrant, and overall, it just runs more smoothly.Buy this, you won't regret it. If you do, you're lame.

  Have had this console since release last year,  it is currently the most powerful console on the market.

  This console upgrade is really great. So far the only games I've played on it have been really good in visual quality & I say that while only currently having a 1080p TV. Why did I get it then? Because I like Xbox & I wanted the most powerful console on the market. You don't NEED 4K gaming to enjoy a game. Just give me 1080p & 60FPS & I'm happy. I have a PS4 & I love Nintendo too, so I'm not one of these Xbox fanboys, I just have preferences.Now, if YOU don't need the most capable console of this generation, Microsoft has made the Xbox One S, which costs less & does everything this console does, but it doesn't play 4K Blu-Rays or output games to 4K. Sony also made the PS4 & Nintendo has the Switch. You have your choices.So, this console is great. The only thing I can't figure out is why Microsoft doesn't include an easy way to stream to either Twitch, or YouTube. Sony put those into the PS4, so Microsoft could do it too. Anyways, most of the people who've put bad reviews of this console either had it fail on them, they're most likely trolls, or they're dumb. For those, I say either request a refund or replacement if it fails on you, don't whine in the review section of the console's page on this site, if you're a troll, stop because you're obvious & annoying, & if you're dumb, stop being dumb & do some research on Google or something before you whine about things that are easily fixable if you did. This console has great graphical capabilities, a good amount of storage (though I'd still suggest getting an external hard drive like I did for storing games you want installed, but aren't currently playing), & a great host of features. This is the most capable console right now & it's more powerful than all the others on the market right now & it's great if you're a more hardcore gamer. It makes games look better than even the PS4 Pro & is meant to be enjoyed, so have your fun.And to the people that'll say Microsoft doesn't have any exclusives, or just get a gaming PC, Microsoft has a lot of exclusives coming, if you even bothered checking, & either let people enjoy console gaming, since it's still a thing, or go enjoy your PC because the console manufacturers will keep making them until the market dies out, so it's a moot point.

  Very happy with my new console. Fast, great build quality and amazing graphics and gameplay. I added an external 4 Terabyte Seagate drive to store the games a couple of weeks later, while I’ll keep my game saves and profile on the internal drive.I do think 1TB is kinda stingy of them for a brand new console, considering just 3 games I have take up almost 9 percent of the drive. Average game download is now 18-40 GB each, especially if you are getting Xbox One enchanced games. I do wish the interface had less self promotion and ads to buy Xbox live and other crap. I know how to go the store tab if I wanted it, but it should be left off the main screen.

  Im really happy with the X, it feels like a generational leap in graphics from the regular Xbox One. Much quieter than my PS4 Pro, and runs full 4K on more new games than the Pro. AC Origins in particular looks incredible on it. Also Halo 5 finally looks the way 343 envisioned it with the 4K HDR update. A must for Xbox fans especially if you have a 4K tv.

  My four year old Xbox one finally gave out on me which gave me a reason to buy the X. I hooked it up to my 4K tv and now gaming monitor has no purpose, there’s no going back to 1080p after playing forza in 4K. Although the performance has increased and the 4K is awesome I wouldn’t spend the money if my old Xbox one was still working.

  The extra horse power is easily apparent from the get go, from the Dashboard and guide being super quick and slick, to the 4k HDR options or on certain titles that can't reach 60fps you have 1080p 60fps ultra settings options and a mix of in between for some games. Games like Gears4, Halo5, AC Origins and Shadow of War are awe inspiring in 4k and 1080p performance mode is a dramatic upgrade on some of these same titles. Hell even games without a patch are running seemlessly and to be honest look alittle better by smoothing over alot of jaggy areas. The console it's self is sexy minimalisum and runs pretty quite. Controller is standard with added texture in the grips. Havent streamed in 4k yet but I have captured and screenshot 4k and it's fast and beautiful.Basically I'm completely happy with buying it, I know 500 seems a bit steep but the console preforms and will no doubt be a part of the next generation will all the power still untapped.

  I have yet to get a 4K TV, so I haven't yet seen in person how good games can look on this console, but what I *can* write a review on is the performance of games compared to the regular Xbox One. With some games on the regular Xbox One (especially Fallout 4) there was lots of stuttering and general lagginess. I was always disappointed by that console's specs and performance...but on the One X, those problems disappear. FPS drops and lag are now extremely rare, and games run so much smoother. The load times are also exponentially better--I did some tests, and sometimes load screens in games are cut in half! It's amazing. Very happy with this purchase, and I'm excited to see how it'll look when I get my 4K TV.I also love how there's no giant power brick, it's just a simple power cord, and the power and eject buttons are actual physical buttons...I can't tell you how many times I accidentally pressed the capacitve buttons on the regular XB1. The console is also more sleek and less noisy than the original One, which is saying something considering it has more advanced hardware!

  The dahsboard is snappy and smooth. The extra power this thing has is not wasted. The games are locked at a steady frame rate, the picture looks crystal clear, even the input lag on my HD TV is mitigated. This is a step up from the competition!!

  This is far the most impressive console I have made thus far... I really won’t waste any funds on any other console than the X... itself... I mean seriously go get one immidietely..If you can’t afford it, get a loan or a CC.. do whatever you have to do and make it happen. It rightly belongs in your home, living room, bedroom, Office etc etc...

  I was an early adopter of the Xbox One original. I liked all the functionalities that it offered, but honestly i had a lot of problems with it. It was slow, loading my tv guide took forever... to the point i thought it froze. it would lose connection to the internet randomly. And admittedly, maybe it was just mine. So the Xbox one S came out and i passed it up, as i figured eh, still not really the console i wanted. In comes the One X.40% more power, full 4K. Its fast, games look amazing, channel guide actually loads fast, this is the Xbox One that should have come from the start. I like this console so much it convinced me to purchase a 4K TV to go along with it. I watched some Amazon 4K streaming, played Forza, and Assassins Creed. Not a single hiccup during these play times, this machine handled it like a champ. It also now has the power supply built into it, so no more power brick. Just a simple removable cable running from the Xbox to your wall.I am taking 1 star off because of two small problems i have had with it so far. I was having trouble getting my controller(s) to start and connect to the console randomly one morning. Held them right in front of it, walked around the room... nothing. Simply did a hard reset, and everything was back to normal. Similarly, Wifi constantly kept dropping one time... i'd connect and it would drop within 5 minutes. Only thing that solved that was a hard reset again. I've only had the system for about 5 days, so i was a little surprised already to be having issues.Besides those easy fixes, the console is a beast, and i love it. If you have any questions please feel free to drop a comment and i will get back to you !

  Despite already owning a powerful gaming PC, I'm loving the X. $500 seems steep, but you get excellent bang for your buck, with native 4K in several games, and more games actually supporting HDR than Windows 10! Xbox might not have the best exclusives, but it's by far the best place to play multi platform titles, and the hardware is extremely high quality in all regards. Add in the nice bonus features like 4K UHD Blu-Ray player, Dolby Atmos support, and you got a great value.

  I bought this to better enjoy my $1000 4k monitor, but it will not do 4k with my specific monitor, even though my PC will.  Very disappointing!  Check carefully to ensure your monitor supports 4k at 60Hz and it supports HDR10.

  I got the Xbox and set it up. It was surprisingly easy for how complex this machine is. There are just a few disappointments with the product I was sent.1) If I wanted to add a Kinect, I would have to buy one and an adapter for this console for the same price as the Kinect itself. Sounds kinda weird for how much they push Kinect functionality.2) The batteries that came wrapped up to use for the controller were corroded and unusable. That seemed like a really weird quality issue.3) The previous problem wouldn't be that big of an issue if they came with a usb cable to temporarily tether the controller to the console. The vibrations in these games are much more pervasive than previous consoles' games so the batteries I put in there ran down FAST.

  There is no learning curve exspecially it you've used an Xbox One. Setup will take a few mainly due to an system update. After that if you have 4K TV you'll want to check your settings to make sure 4K output is selected. Also, if upgrading from Xbox One / Xbox One S, using an exturnal hard drive will speed up and reduced bandwidth usage of having to download games and apps again. You can also use Network Transfer and copy games from your other Xbox.Performance is unmatched by any other console available today and for the next few years. You will notice reduced load times for all your games you own currently. (I can't say this will always be the case as game devs truly take full advantage to this power house).Games look amazing and yes even games that haven't been patched yet for the X. It is a nice and clean looking console. If you have a game that supports HDR and 4K you will not be sorry. Absolutely amazing well worth the money!

  So far I have had zero issues with the Xbox one, and it runs a lot quiter than my ps4 does which is very surprising. The included controller is decent but i still prefer the Elite controller. The console finish is okay, but i wish they offered a two tone color scheme like the xbox one s... all black is kind of boring, but at least it looks pretty matte for the shade of black.My biggest complaint is the fact that 1TB is just too small for having larger files sizes (like halo, gears of war, and forza 100 GB+ each). To upgrade If you open your console you void your warranty and i'm not a fan of external hard drives. Overall it looks great on my TV (lg oled 65in 4k) but not better that the ps4 pro. More games for the XBOX need to have 60 frames per second for the level of performance it can deliver.

  After ordering one and finding out a unit has a terrible grinding noise so I got a replacement from amazon and the replacement unit is doing the same thing. So I contacted amazon and they said they cannot offer me another replacement as they are having issues with their inventory.. They even went so far as to say that I should order it from another retailer! This was a complete shock... so I'm giving MS another shot by ordering from BestBuy bc I bought several games for the xbox that i cannot play without an xbox......

  As a multi-platform game enthusiast I can say I am really impressed with the visual fidelity that this new machine provides. I'm using it in conjunction with a Sony Bravia 43 inch 4K HDR TV and the visuals this device delivers are fantastic. For reference I also own and PS4 pro and have a dedicated gaming PC with a core i7 and a GTX 1080 that I've compared it against. Obviously the PC will outperform it but at nearly 3 times the cost. You can't build a PC that would get this performance for 499. The only downside is that you are dependent on developers doing the work to make the enhancements to their games, but I will say that anything with a dynamic resolution will still look sharper on this device. Gears of War 4 and Forza 7 are night and day compared to the standard Xbox one on my screen. Even the enhanced 360 games like Gears of War 3 look really nice up-scaled to 1080p. Unless you just don't like Microsoft exclusives, if you have a 4K panel and 499 to spare this should be the console for you.

  People have to understand this is a 500 dollar 4k gaming console with a 4k DVD drive... Let me know what the cost will be for pc. Mine was double and barely does 4k at 30 lol. Then again my PC is four years old. For what this console does its a great price. Right now I have a 1080p TV so I have a few games that's upscaled to 4k and they do look Alot better so I can't wait till I get a 4k TV to see how amazing movies and games will look.

  From the moment I opened up the box, I could tell this console is constructed well and is of great quality. I have a PS Pro and was excited to go back to the Xbox because it has a better community and interface of entertainment options. I like my PS Pro, but it doesn't compare the new Xbox One X. The graphics are much sharper and there's more detail on the X. The X also  runs much quieter than my Pro. All around, the X is the best console I've ever purchased and I'm enjoying seeing my games like the new Star Wars Battlefront 2 in all their glory!

  This thing is a beast, now they just need some better content. I also think the operating system is still not laid out intuitively with lots of clutter giving it a segemented feeling when going from app to app. It also still seems that they have a problem optimizing their operating system with the hardware. My only hardware gripe would be that I feel it needs a stronger WiFi antenna, it doesn’t seem to have same signal strength as other devices of mine in the same location.

  This console is everything I want in a gaming console and the center of my home entertainment. The graphic enhancement are seriously noticeable, smooth and well polished. You don’t need to own a High end PC to get the best looking games anymore. Finally, unlike the PS4, the Xbox One X does do NATIVE 4K resolution instead upscaled 1080 or Dynamic 4K if developers choose to.

  So far so good.  I have had this XBOX One X for about 2 weeks and it’s good for what it is.  The 4K feature is good, but nothing spectacular.If it wasn’t for the games and the multiplayer capabilities that a PC doesn’t have, I would have skipped this product.  It’s not hard to save up a little money and get a quality PC with a GTX 1080 or even GTX 1070.Overall a good console and would recommend for those who don’t want to spend 1500 for a good PC.

  So had the xbox for a week. Kept having loading issues. Then it just stopped loading to start. Called tech support you know the cure for all problems hard reset. Started up and froze. Couldn't do anything at all. Very disappointed since I had my original xbox for years now and no problem. My kids even have a xbox S no problems. Yet this one major issues. When it did work graphics are great if you have a 4k HDR tv if not just get an S. So contacted Amazon and sent it back. They will not send me another one once they received this one. Only option money back on card and reorder. Really debating on if I should try another one. Will keep you updated if I do.

  After owning the original Xbox One from launch, helping a friend set-up an Xbox One S and now buying an Xbox One X, it's unfortunate, but I can safely, new Xbox, same issues! OK let's get this out of the way, I was shocked at how small this system is in person, it was half the size of my UHD Blu-Ray Player and it is built of very high quality, and get this, the power cord is thinner than the HDMI Cable, think Apple TV thin! This system however runs Very Hot, hotter than any other system, including my laptop, and it constantly blows hot air from the rear, so don't even think of putting this anywhere it may block the rear vents, it is however very quiet, with exception to a disc loading data, that is audible, not game breaking but audible. Here is the BIGGEST Issue(s) however, with all this extra power, all this fine workmanship, MS still has not addressed issues plaguing this machine since day one! The menus are still convoluted and horrible to navigate, so much so I swear it has gotten worse than my launch XB1. Installing games, takes FOREVER and worse than that, I can't count how many times I brought game to the front to prompt it to download, I walked away and it went back to ""Query"" while another started downloading in the background (I was downloading multiple titles and updates). This has been an issue since the day the console launched and MS refuses to acknowledge it, this was a game breaker for me as it was my single biggest complaint from my original unit.I also had strange issues with setting up the audio, it kept telling me it could not find the output, in the end I used bitstream optical, event though I was connected with HDMI, audio sounded great, crisp and clear, but it was kind of an annoyance to not let me select my current set-up, strangely I do not remember this issue with my older unit, may have something to do with the inclusion Atmos in XB1X.Another issue I encountered was with the game ""Killer Instinct"". This game still has the same HORRIBLE character select screen latency/three second pause in between moving the cursor from one character to the next. This issues was present all the way from day one launch and it is still not fixed, even with the updated horsepower, my PC, which is not as powerful as an XB1X plays this game flawlessly with zero latency, why can't the console that it was created on (and for) do the same?In the end the unit had to go back to Amazon as it had an issue where it was scratching discs upon insertion/exit, ironically my original XB1 had the exact same issue, but once the console was replaced it was fine there after. This console however went back for a refund, I will not be looking to replacing it, too many issues (from launch not ironed out) along with new ones (audio, menus, etc.) that seemed to be absent in my prior run with the console. It's a real shame as MS has a winner on it's hands with this console, but if they're not willing to fix issues that were present from day one, there is no sense in going through the hassle of owning one.

  The console is nice but has drawbacks, all games need to be uploaded, that kills your memory capacity. For a console with the fastest processor, downloading games or updates takes fotever. The only reason I bought it was because its backward compatible, and I own a lot of 360 games.

  I'm an xbox/Microsoft fanboy.I have bought every console. Firsts xbox, xbox 360, 360 arcade, 360 elite, 360 slim, 360 e model, xbox one day one, xbox one s, and now the xbox one x.And as I have seen a major increase in graphics and load times in the x. I have to say it's been a waste of my life, Time, and money. Nonetheless the x has had issues since day one of my purchase. It failed to update, or more precise it appeared as though it failed to update. Then it did it again. I thought maybe it's a power issue and plugged it in all by itself and still it is not working. Its progressively getting worse. I have no option but to return this and hope to god it was a faulty unit.Back note. My first xbox one day one edition accidentally had a beer knocked over and spilled into it. I dried it out and plugged it in and it worked. For another year.  This, is not even 2 months of moderate use and its junk.In my consumer opinion, wait for the next gen xbox, the xbox one x is not worth it, on my amazing 4k LG tv I only noticed that the colors look better then the s. And load times are quicker but only by seconds it's not going to be instantaneous

  I decided to purchase the Xbox One X after having the standard console for quite a while.I've only had the unit for 3 months, and already, there are hardware Issues. The network adapter drops constantly, controllers and wireless mic's randomly disconnect, only fixable by a hard reset. The unit also runs hot and generally seems unstable.Maybe I got a lemon. The problem is the warranty. I am only eligable for a replacement refurbished unit via Xbox. That doesn't seem right. I may as well have purchased a refurbished unit from the start. Amazon wasn't willing to offer any help, and instead, referred me back to Xbox support.If you purchase from Amazon, I would suggest a 3rd party unit in case you get a lemon like I did.

  This review is on the XBOX ONE X 1TB Console, It has better graphics than the XBOX, I did not notice much of a change in performance than an Xbox ! that could be due to the over heating  issue 149.9 degrees taken with a INFRARED THERMOMETER and the system would not shut down had to pull the power cord out of the back of it.

  Follow-up: Since I have received the replacement XBox, I have had a much more pleasurable experience. Everything works, the games install and load as expected, downloads seem to work just fine without issue, and so on. I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 because of my initial experience, but overall I'm pleased with the console.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Preamble: I went back and forth between purchasing an Xbox One and a Playstation 4, but decided on the Xbox because of the 4K blu-ray player. Might have been better off just buying a 4K blu-ray player.--Diary--Friday: Xbox arrives on my doorstep in the afternoon. Cool! Unbox the unit, no instructions other than a thin booklet with warnings written in various languages. Go online. A/V setup seems pretty straight forward, plug it in, put batteries in the remote (no instructions on how to link with console), and fire it up. Box starts up and goes into initial setup. Get to screen where initial update takes place, starts to download update package (about 800Mb or so), process stops about 100MB in. Re-boot, get a few more MB on the update download, stops again. Re-boot again, few more MB, at this point I say enough, go out to dinner with my wife (who is wondering why I started this evolution before going to dinner). Get back home, more reboots, finally do a full system reset, some E102 and E105 errors in there, and miraculously by about 1AM everything seem to be set up. Call it a night and go to bed, remembering that I haven't had this much fun since installing OS/2 back in the day, when you had to laboriously feed 36 floppies for the install, only to have it fail at the end and start over...Saturday: Get up, hesitantly push the power on button (will it boot up?) when I am greeted by the Home screen. Hooray! Put in ""Planet Earth II"" to test out the 4K Blu-ray. Looks gorgeous! Watch a few shows on Amazon and Netflix, looks great, Amazon app a little weird in that you cannot purchase content from it, so had to start up the Amazon app on the TV to rent a movie, then go back to the Xbox app to watch it. Beautiful day!Sunday: Get up, put in another 4K movie (Blade Runner), get a message that it cannot read the disk. Restart the Xbox. Same message. Put in the Planet Earth II disk that worked fine the day before. Can't read the disk. After doing some Internet research, discover that the fix is to do a system reset, preserving games and apps. Remembering the debacle on Friday night, tentatively do so. Box resets, have to go back and set everything back up, put in disk, and now it can load the movie (Blade Runner). Watch first part of the movie, wondering what I've gotten myself into with this Xbox.Monday: Have the day off, so I decide to download Doom III. About 58 GB, takes about 1.5 hours to download. Download halts a couple of times, have to back out and restart, but finally completes. Fire it up, looks great, but after about a minute of game play, get a warning that it cannot save the game. Back out to start screen, game ""slot 1"" says corrupt file. Do some Internet research, solution seems to be do a system reset, preserving games. Reset game console, set it back up, load Doom, works great, looks awesome. Play for about an hour or so.Tuesday: Forza 6 comes in the mail. Awesome! Put the disk in the console, installation process starts, system tells me that an update will need to be downloaded (about 8 GB) in order to play, say ok, install restarts, where the game console is slowly copying the game files from the disk while simultaneously downloading the update. Process stops after about 1/2 hour. Back out, restart, process starts again. Stops again. Back out again, Xbox won't restart this time, get E105 error. Finally decide that I've had enough, do a full system reset to clear out any saved information, box it back up, notify Amazon to send me a replacement.Maybe I received a defective Xbox and a new one will work better. But even so, the platform seems to me to be somewhat half baked and particularly fault intolerant, where any issue with the seemingly complex chain of events needed to load and play a game is enough to literally make the box unusable and force a system reset, which may or may not be time consuming depending on how much content you have downloaded, but is still certainly an annoyance. So even if there was a hardware malfunction causing the problem, the system does not seem to be all the stable on a good day. Besides which, this is not a console where you can just put in a disk and start playing a game. It seems that you will need a fast broadband connection (and no download limits!) and will still need to allocate an hour or two on the initial setup, even if you own the game on disk. Exciting!Lesson learned: After four days with this console, I liken it to playing Russian Roulette with rubber bullets. If this is the future of game play, then buy a pack of cards. You'll need them anyway to play solitaire while waiting for your games to install.

  Microsoft proclaimed this as the most powerful console ever, and they weren't lying. If you a 4k tv (even if it's not HDR as well), I would highly recommend getting this as I feel it is worth the price tag. Even though only a select few xbox one games are ""4k enhanced"", all xbox games will look amazing on this, hell even the recently made backwards compatible original xbox game Knights of the Old Republic looks stellar on it. The loading times and increased framerate are awesome as well. 4k movies look good and there is a amazon video app that does 4k. What more could you want? If you can afford the price, get it now.

  Complete garbage. HUGE issues with the start up not working and riddled with system errors and corrupt system files. Spent several hours just trying to get it turned on and to the home screen. Had to download a factory reset file from Xbox.com, once I went through that process anything I tried to download or update (games and apps) the installation would stop and not restart; whether from disc or online. I bought an external drive and stored everything on there hoping that would help and it did at first. Then once I had access to games it notified me that my saved game data stored on the Xbox was corrupt and that I needed to go into the settings to delete and re-sync it. I did this twice and ended up losing +25 hours of gameplay and even then was forced to factory reset the system TWICE this morning. Due to an exchange not being offered I bought a whole new system and have returned this one. Indescribably disappointed with this entire transaction.

Maybe a bit disappointed though.

  I purchased this shortly after it released in November last year. It worked great for a few months, I have now had it for five months and it randomly stopped reading and inserting/ejecting discs, which is probably one of the most basic things any console should be able to do. I don't understand how you are going to release a $500 console and make it to not last more than a few months? I suggest buying a yearly warranty just in case this happens to you.

  So I bought the Xbox One X anticipating that it was going to be the deal that moved me into the Xbox/Microsoft world. It arrived a day early and I was off to the races. I bought gold live, an extra controller, and a couple of games to make the switch enjoyable. There were minor issues including lag from home page to other apps, there was always an issues with random drops on connection, and there was always an issues with games randomly closing. I assumed it was either a wifi problem or just my inexperience with Xbox. As the weeks go by the issues increase and soon become a huge annoyance. After about two months, the xbox became unplayable. I could not connect to the internet with either wifi/ethernet. I could not play any games because they were all corrupted. I could hardly move from Home page. Friends lists never loaded. So I did what any person should do when they have no idea what to do, I contacted Xbox support and they ran me through some trouble shooting solutions. After following them to the dot the Xbox became playable again. At least for an hour or two, and then it would go back to its broken state. I went through support about 3-4 times until I just told them I wanted a new one. Luckily for me I was still under warranty because I had only purchased it not too many months ago. So I went through the process and sent it in. The neat part about the process is you can see when it arrives and when it fixed and when its shipped. Well after about a Month I finally got what I believe to be a refurbished Xbox. Ecstatic to have a fixed console I start playing once again. Not more than two weeks go by and I am having a whole new set of hardware issues. The controllers have issues connecting to the Xbox, games seem to freeze and are corrupted. What really through me over the edge though. I had just purchased a new game and I have been waiting months to play Sea of Thieves. I am unable to buy the game through the store on my console, so I head over to my laptop and buy it off the Microsoft site. Soon enough I am downloading the game onto my console so I head into another room and about 25 minutes later I head back to see how far the game has installed and my Xbox is frozen on the ""Trouble Shooting Screen."" I am unable to do anything so I unplug the console form the power source and wait a couple of minutes. I contact customer support and we hard reset the xbox again. They are now going to send me a brand new Xbox and I am to send my faulty xbox to them. They are charging me a $15 dollar processing fee as well as a $500+ deposit in case I don't send in my Xbox. I will keep you guys updated but hopefully my issues will be fixed and I won't get furthermore screwed.-Feb 10Order has been started but no replacement Xbox has been shipped yet. Current Xbox is malfunctioning and is becoming unplayable.-Feb 20New Xbox has arrives, I will be sending the broken one awaiting my hold to be taken off.-Feb 25

  So I have an Xbox One already.  When Microsoft announced the Xbox One X I was excited because now I could maybe stand a chance against my PC friends.  And what I got was an ""okay"" upgrade.I got a list of the Xbox One X Enhanced Games and was sure to try them: the Witcher 3, Dishonored 2, Fallout 4, Skyrim, Deus Ex, Mass Effect, Shadow of War, etc etc.  And after I tried them and I was not impressed.  Most games would maybe increase draw distance or slightly increase the graphics, or change the textures.  Fewer games would change the FPSs or make you choose between 60fps or 4K.  But when I am paying paying TWICE the cost for a product I want to see more than just subtle changes and that is what I got.For that reason, I returned the product and got my money back.  Maybe in the future it will be worth it but for now, save $250 and stick with the Xbox One.

  5 months in and it stopped working, I shouldn't be surprised, this is a microsoft product (happened with my 360 numerous times).I had to send it in to microsoft for service, ridiculous to buy a new product at launch only to have it stop working months later.I wish amazon would just give me a new one but thats not the way it works (they told me to call microsoft).Guess im just one of the unlucky.

  It is a really good product if you already upgraded to a 4K tv and a good Internet connection so the console is really good. The controller is the thing I don't understand, this is the fourth I have and it just lasted 45 days, I play more than casual but not all day and the thumbstick always got damaged, starts moving by itself, I think that paying $500 deserves something better. I can send it back but that's not the idea of a good and well designed product. Another thing, why I have to pay $40 for an adapter to my Kinect, more money to Microsoft?

  I'd rate the Xbox One X a 4 1/2 star, but since that isn't possible on the Amazon rating system, I'll go ahead and award this console a 5-star.I had no intention of purchasing the Xbox One X because I'm an owner of a PS4 Pro and a high-end gaming PC that's equipped with a GTX 1080 Ti SC2 Hybrid. But my wife wouldn't take no for an answer when I told her that I didn't want anything for my birthday, so I gave in :D.The console is smaller than its predecessors, but it's surprisingly heavy. The design is sleek, which I find far more attractive than the sandwich-design of the PS4 Pro. Compared to Sony's DS4, I much prefer the feel and look of the Xbox One controller, especially in FPS games. However, I still do not understand why Microsoft is so reluctant to include a rechargeable battery pack for the controller or a micro-USB cord (the PS4 comes with both!). I have a handful of micro-USB cords lying around, but they defeat the purpose of the wireless functionality of the controller. I don't want to spend money on freaking AA batteries whenever they run out of juice. And I sure as hell don't want to spend extra on rechargeable battery packs. The Xbox One X is $500! FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS! With that premium price, at least make the controller rechargeable like the DS4.In terms of performance, the X is indeed a monster, but not the kind that Microsoft would like you to believe. Despite their claim that this console can deliver ""true 4k,"" the X utilizes the same checkerboard technology of the PS4 Pro, albeit with a higher resolution. If you are still uncertain, you can look up videos by Digital Foundry, who delves into great technical detail regarding the performance of the Xbox One X. The console's 6 teraflop video card is very powerful for a gaming device of its kind, but it pales in comparison to what's currently available in the GPU market. Games that were released in the last three years will look incredible and perform well on the X due to the higher horsepower. But AAA titles are becoming more hardware demanding every year, so it'll be interesting to see how the Xbox One X carry itself in the next 2-4 years, assuming the console cycle will last that long. In the meantime, however, all multi-platform games will undoubtedly look better on the X than they will on the PS4 Pro.But sadly, Microsoft's library of exclusive games is anemic. While Sony continues to push out enticing previews of upcoming exclusive games, Microsoft backpedals to the games of the past. The list is quite vast, but most of the Xbox 360 games that I own and want to play have yet to be made backwards compatible, which renders the functionality completely pointless at this time. As a long time ardent fan of the Halo series, I would love to play Halo: Reach with an Xbox One X enhanced visuals, HDR, and 60fps. But given 343 Industries' peculiar reluctance to support the fan favorite Halo game, I highly doubt that Reach will ever receive the upgrade that it deserves. So please, Microsoft and 343, do yourselves and the fans a favor: give Halo: Reach, one the best Xbox 360 exclusive titles, an Xbox One X Enhancement!Regardless of Microsoft's misleading claims, the X packs quite a bit for $500. Unlike the PS4 Pro, the Xbox One X is equipped with a 4k HDR Blu-ray player, which alone retails for $200. Thus, the console is a very well rounded home device, and it also gives me a reason to start collecting movie DVDs again. And in 4K HDR! Combine all this with my new LG 43UJ63 that I purchased recently, my setup is practically complete!My final criticism regarding the X is its limited storage capacity. 1TB may seem large, but it will fill up extremely fast due to the 4K assets of enhanced games.

  Update 3-10-18A very interesting feature I found for the Xbox One X is that at a system level, games that have 4K assets or resolutions higher than 1080p would be super-scaled to fit regular full-HD screens. What this means is, even those who don’t have a 4K TV can benefit from sharper image quality. Be it the likes of Shadow of War and Rise of the Tomb Raider or even Halo 5 and LA Noire, every game looks great on either display. This is a far cry from the PS4 Pro, wherein the game developer has to provision for it. Hopefully Sony decides to go the Xbox way with a future update. Until then, games on the Xbox One X have an advantage in terms of graphical fidelity.This Xbox one x is by far the most powerful console to date with 7 teraflops of computing power some of the newest chips blue ray and 4K functionality and more! What I’m most impressed with is the speed and quality of gameplay as well as COLLECTION OF GAMES!! The amount of games that support 4K for launch is unbelievable! Microsoft you really outdid yourself here! I highly recommend this console if you’re an Xbox fan you will highly enjoy this and if your PlayStation but want a faster console with this capability it won’t disappoint hope this helps!

  I don’t think I’ve ever taken the time to write a review for a product before, so please know that I am so angry with how my Xbox One X turned out to be. It is literally UNUSABLE!!!After having the original Xbox One Day One Edition (OG) since its release, I thought it was time for an upgrade. I replaced my OG’s place in my room with the new X. It wasn’t long until I realized that the X had a really hard time holding on to a wireless network connection via my home wifi. A problem that I NEVER previously had with my OG. Online games will never load due to the cutting in/out, watching any type of video is unbearable because of buffering, and the console is never automatically connected to wifi when I turn it on (in the slim chance that it can even detect nearby wifis at all!!!).It’s not my wifi, as I had no problems in the past with my OG and all other electronics connect perfectly. I’ve tried restaring, rebotting both the system and my router, but nothing will work. After doing some research online, I have learned that this was a common issue when the X originally released. Apparently it still is!!! UNBELIEVABLE!!! I hate this machine so much!!!! Now I have to go through the hassle of retuning this pile of garbage.

  It's better than the Xbox One S. ""$250"" more better? That is really subjective. I'd did it to help extend my console investment, maximising how many years I should expect the best possible results from the device. Please note, your $500 purchase doesn't entitle you a stand, you get to pay another $15 to $20 dollars for that if you want or need it. Thanks, Micrososft!

  I bought an Xbox one x last week and it’s my first Xbox ever.  I’ve always been on PlayStation and I own the ps4 and ps4 pro.  Comparing the Xbox one to the ps4 is a tough one and overall and I think I still would pick PlayStation as a first pick in future consoles.  The reason why is because Sony just does it right.  While Xbox does have nifty features, such as backwards compatibility, cross play from pc to Xbox, etc.  The one major problem I noticed is that it seems Xbox has more technical flaws with it. I have never had any issues with the PlayStation, on hardware malfunction, etc.  The Xbox however I noticed it acts more like a pc.  I’m browsing through Microsoft store and there is lag scrolling through the games.  I joined an Xbox community on Facebook, and I’m always seeing someone asking for help with a technical issue.  I hope I don’t have any of those issues and time will tell.  The ui on the Xbox really needs a makeover.  It can be really annoying to navigate to get to where you want, as on the ps4, it’s not.  For example, destiny 2 expansions, it shows right up under the ps4 title, making it very accessible to buy.  On Xbox, I have to go to the game page, click destiny 2 with expansion, and then click on the expansion.  It’s pretty tedious.  One thing I almost forgot is hard drive swapping.  Ps4, its pretty simple and sony makes it really easy.  As for xbox, you pretty much have to take the whole thing I part.  You're better off buying an external hard drive.Game wise the, Xbox performs beautifully and I can see why people go with the system.  The ps4 pro and Xbox one x are pretty comparable when it comes to running games, and I noticed it really depends on the game and developer to make the 4k visual outstanding.  I’ve read article where this game on ps4 pro looks better.  Then I see another game where it looks better on Xbox one x.Another nifty feature that I wish the ps4 would have is a game pass.  I like how some of the new Xbox games go straight to the pass and you can play before buying or just keep a subscription. Then also play that game on pc.  Which is pretty awesome.  The backwards compatibility is another great feature I wish ps4 would have and I wish Sony would have kept that trend.  While the ps4 has PS now, it’s not as great, since you have to rely on internet to stream the game.Overall, I’m still pretty satisfied  I got the Xbox and how it acts until the next consoles come out will determine if I keep getting both systems. I'm still giving it 5 stars just because of the nifty stuff it can do.

  I don't understand all the hype that surrounded this newer console. I had an Xbox One for a year and a half and while it did lag, and games froze or crashed, it wasn't all that bad. I preferred it over the PS3 I had, so I didn't complain.Delayed buying this newer version mainly because of the price (which I feel is vastly outrageous), and since my games played well enough on my old one, I figured I'd wait a bit.Well, I finally broke down and bought it, and now I wish to hell I hadn't. It's worse than the old console; games freeze or crash about twice as much, and I can see no difference in graphics at all (though to be fair, that may be my TV's fault and not the unit, idk.)I would have sent it back, but I'd already promised my old console to someone, assuming this one would live up to all the great things people were saying and writing about the X.

Additionally, it sometimes doesn't even allow me to sign in until I restart the console several times until it inexplicably starts working. It is insanely laggy even without internet as well. It simply does not function anywhere properly. I have to buy a new one. Truly unacceptable. There was no damage ever done to the Xbox. Straight out of the box it has problems.

  The Xbox One X is the best console on the market right now, hands down. It's the only console where you can legitimately get native 4K graphics with HDR. The PS4 Pro usually produces a fake 4K using checkerboard and this is evident in the most recent release (as of writing this review) Red Dead Redemption 2. The PS4 Pro version, while a beautiful game, is obviously subpar when compared against the Xbox One X. The one thing the PS4Pro does have going for it though are games, and that is something you need to consider when buying this console.When you decide on buying a console, you are mainly looking for two things. 1) where are my friends going to be playing and 2) what exclusive games are on the console. Sony has Microsoft beat by a country mile with exclusives. You'll be able to play all third party games though (think Assassins Creed, Call of Duty, etc.) but games specific to Sony will only be on the PS4 system, and they are numerous. I have both consoles and while I always play third party games on my Xbox One X, I wouldn't want to miss some of the games on the PS4.So, with that out of the way, how is the console itself? It's amazing. Beautiful 4K gaming with HDR, a great online experience, and the console is whisper silent. You take for granted just how quiet a console is until you get a loud console like the PS4 Pro. It's one of the reasons I wanted to get an Xbox One X, playing games on the PS4 Pro was like playing them next a vacuum cleaner. Don't believe me? Youtube it...it's jarring.All in all, the console is amazing and I love it. If you want to experience all of the big games out there, the PS4 will probably be more your speed because you'll be missing out on some if this is your only console. But, if you already have a PS4 or have friends on the Xbox ecosystem, you're in for one heck of a console!

  Xbox has internet connectivity issues. Apps and Games take AGES to open (I’m talking like 2-3 minutes). No 4K & if there is the HDMI that comes with it does not support 4K (why include it?).

  I bought the original Xbox One at launch in 2013. After 5 years, it was still going strong, but load times on certain games were long and I hated that my next gen console, while better than the 360, could barely handle 1080p at decent frame rates. It was disappointing but I made do as I’m strictly a casual, console player.I upgraded my TV to 4K HDR so I figured now was the time to look at the XOX. After reading reviews and waiting for a good deal, I got it at a reasonable price (much less than retail). I was a little afraid that I wouldn’t be able to notice the difference in picture quality and performance because some reviewers gave it bad marks.However, after doing a long evening of installs, I am very impressed with performance. For starters, load times were drastically reduced for several of the games I played. Destiny 2 had no frame rate drops during a 12 person public event, no loading pauses while exploring planets on the sparrow. Visually, everything did in fact look much sharper and smoother. Not just a little bit either, but an actual difference. I was pleasantly surprised.Opening some other games, I noticed a lot of the same. Noticeably better graphics and performance.I will say, if you plan to get this, you should do a review of your TV capabilities to get the most out of the console. I was irritated to learn that I can’t use all the features because my TV doesn’t support the right standards. This was frustrating as hell to be honest because I thought all 4K HDR should be supported on the device, but apparently my TV isn’t fancy enough for the console.All in all, I’d recommend it because it does work a LOT better than the original console in nearly every aspect. But definitely invest a little more for a top end TV to get the most out of it.

  If you're looking for the best graphics games have to offer I must say the Xbox One X falls very short of the performance that most gaming PCs will achieve. With that said, for the price the Xbox One X is a bargain considering what it can do when a game is optimized well. The 4K output is crisp although the checkerboarding method used to achieve it leaves subtle artifacts just like on the PS4 Pro. Games will look good but, there is usually quite a bit of aliasing left. This means you will still get a slightly softer image overall when compared most games best settings in 4K. Not all games display in 4k and the games that do don't always stay in 4k. The fps in some games still does leave something to be desired and you will notice that some games will have occasional framerate and/or resolution drops at times. The PS4 Pro is not quite as powerful but, for most games there really isn't much difference in quality between it and the One X. Still, if you are looking to play the newest games in 4k this is the most powerful console to do it on and at low price compared to PC.

  As a disclaimer, it's still (very, very) early on so things can change. I'll update this review if/when they do, but for now this is more of a 4-star product since it falls short in many areas.THE PRICE. You can grab a brand new Xbox One S with 3 games (and a built in UHD 4k drive) for 200 bucks. The XBox One X costs 2.5 times that at 500. For that you get the same 4K UHD drive, same controller, no games but a beefed up system. While the system is an upgrade over the PS4 Pro, that system is also a year older and came out 100-bucks less.Inside the box are a standard XBox One controller, 2 batteries (no rechargable pack included; this is optional), an HDMI cable and a power cable. I was disappointed that there is no stand for the console unless you buy the ""Scorpio Edition"" and that there is no mic/headphone in-box.CAPACITY: Another big issue is the capacity. Out of the box you get a 1TB Drive. Mine had about 780GB of actual usable space. While this might be fine for an Xbox One or PS4.. the 4K textures on these games are insane. Quantum Break, for instance, is 180GB. That's 1/4 of the capacity of the system and also means you'll need to download all 180GB of it.For something that has such large games (others are near 100GB each), it's insane to only have a 1TB drive. If you have to uninstall/re-install games, you'll need to re-download these. While you can buy external drives, these are another expense.4K UHD Player: A big selling point here since these players can cost quite a bit (I own the OPPO UDP-203 which is more than the Xbox One X); the downside is that the Xbox will not output DolbyVision HDR. With this being the superior form of HDR, Xbox One X Only allows for HDR10.AUDIO: Similarly to the Xbox One/Xbox One S, enabling Dolby Atmos for headphones is another 15-dollar purchase. The console does have audio output via HDMI and Optical audio which is nice.GAMES: The big thing here are the games. Play all your Xbox One games and also some backwards compatibility with the Xbox 360 and original Xbox. Nice!Xbox One games which are enhanced via patches are a free upgrade (also nice!)The Xbox One X is not an ""Xbox Two"", it's still an Xbox One but with some much beefed-up insides. There are no XboxOneX-only games, all games must be backwards compatible with the Xbox One  (from 2013). This is nice but also a disappointment as you're paying next-gen-console prices for current-gen games and hoping they're enhanced. Some games aren't but may run better.. others match the PS4 Pro in terms of upgrades.With so many consoles (the lower-spec Xbox One X, the PS4, last years' PS4 Pro and the most powerful Xbox One X (not to mention the switch)), the games will need to run on all consoles and will be designed for such. This may limit the games we see on the Xbox One X since they need to run well on the older consoles also. Will developers take the time to put out multiple versions of these games?VR: One big benefit of the PS4 Pro is the VR. The Pro enhanced the PSVR system and allows for better gameplay. This is a big selling point of the Pro, but Xbox currently does not have any type of VR system.So what does the X do? it  does 4K and does it great. I feel a bit let down by all of the issues above, but it is the most powerful console out there. I just wish I didn't have to spend so much on it and still have an incomplete system.I'm looking forward to what it has to offer (and bought the console knowing it will be a longer term 'investment' to allow keep playing these games in the best way possible) but the future remains to be seen.With the PS4 Pro already cheaper and a year old, will we be seeing a PS5 soon?Even the original Xbox One is 4 years old. I don't  know if Microsoft can keep this going for another 4-5 years on this hardware.

  For $500 you get a Vega architecture GPU that's capable of pushing 4k games, UHD BluRay, a TB of storage and it's all packed in a sleek package. I do not currently own a 4k TV, will invest in a LG SJ8*** at some time, but honestly the upgraded horsepower is translated to 1080p with upgraded graphics. Coming from a midrange PC, I played GOW4 at medium presets and compared to the quality of the One X the PC fell short. So I know some have said don't bother unless you have a 4k television but that's far from the truth, seeing the performance at 1080p and how awesome it looks only shows that at 4k it can be even better.So to wrap it up I sold my PC to get a Xbox One X and I don't regret it in the least! You'd be hard pressed to build a PC to match what you get with the One X you'd easily spend double the cost of the One X.

  For the record, I game on a Vega 56, i5-8600K @ 4.9GHz. I've owned a Nintendo Switch, 3DS, Xbox One, Xbox One S, PS4, PS4 Pro, PS3, Xbox 360, and the list goes on.But in terms of which console has won me over for pure value, it is the Xbox One X. Nothing on the market even comes close to what you are getting in this package. If buying into the newest trends have taught me something over the years, it's that not everything is completely worth your hard-earned money.So why buy an Xbox One X if I own a Vega 56? It's honestly quite simple. I absolutely hate playing on a Keyboard and Mouse. I can't stand it. I've done it for years, I tried to like it. But it isn't for me. And not every PC game has the greatest controller support, and some don't have any at all. Case in point: Path of Exile. Wonderful game. Controller support on PC? None. You have to play it on Xbox for that. There are many others, but this is a good example.Now the first Xbox One X I received on launch day was defective. Hard lock-ups, couldn't play more than 10 minutes without it restarting itself. However, the second one I got recently was absolutely perfect. No issues whatsoever. Keep in mind that if you experience issues don't hesitate to return it and get an exchange. Buy the Xbox One X at BestBuy if you'd like to streamline this. They will exchange without any questions asked.As it stands, if I could only own one console. It would be the Xbox One X. I'd recommend one to anyone. From hardcore computer gamer to casual. The visual fidelity and performance is bar-none the best you will ever get at this price point.

  Just a note, didn't purchase on Amazon got it from the Microsoft Store Online so I could pay using PayPal.  Now for my review,Just plain Awesome!!! Now I am coming from a Original Xbox One, The footprint it takes up is shockingly small compared to my One. It is also super quiet! Also just to note I have it hooked up to a 43 inch Vizio LED 1080P TV (120hz)  and the difference in graphics and how smooth the games run is really amazing. I do wish it came with a bigger internal Hard drive but I already had a 4TB drive hooked up to my One which is now delegated to the bed room due to our bedroom tv is not smart so we can use it for Netflix and other streaming apps. I really question the 1 star reviews that are not Verified purchases. I really think it's people trying to bring down the overall score of the One X. This really is a quality machine if you can afford it. I have played Call of Duty World War 2 and Wolfenstein 2 and Forza 7 all look and play amazing. Also tried out Quantum Break and boy does that run so much smoother!!!  Very Happy with my Purchase!!! If anything changes I will update but I have had it running 24 hours straight and all is well.  Oh did have a little hiccup with the initial update I had to ""hit re-try"" once, also installing games take a while but that is the norm with all the new consoles so people giving it once star for that is just plane ridiculous!

  Honestly I had high hopes for this system, despite reading some of the negative reviews I figured people tend to exaggerate. Unfortunately 5 days after I got my Xbox One X I was in the middle of playing a game and the system shut off on me. I tried to power it on again and it wouldn't turn on, after speaking to a Micrsoft rep he told me he would send me another power cord cause that's what the problem sounded like. So I tried that and still wouldn't turn on. I finally got fed up and sent it back for a refund and got another Xbox One S. Needless to say I won't be getting another one X. I'm so sick of Microsoft's products always failing on me I might just convert to Sony!!!

  MICROSOFT'S premium CONSOLE IS NOW DISCONTINUED, BUT THE CURRENT PRICE ON THE LAST ONES AVAILABLE IS POSITIVELY INCREDIBLE. While the Console is fantastic, I have to bring up a few blatant negatives yet to be resolved- but from the XBOX domain apart from this amazing unit. Firstly; XBOX continues to cater to slobs who love shooters, and I have yet to finish a single RPG- my favorite type of game- including past backward-compatible titles. Second- the dreadful onslaught of pathetic EA sports games. Third- action-games often allocated to the RPG section of titles. Fourth- abysmal Web interface that downloads at 1/3 the speed of my PS4. But I have some hope- since Kemco has been providing turn-based old-fashioned and adorable RPG'S at the manageable price of $14.99 a title. The games are in the vein of ""As-Divine"" and are simply FUN to play! In addition, the last breed of 360 titles like ""Blue Dragon"" and ""Lost Odyssey"" are always going to be among my fave X-Box offerings. However- a dark spot on X-Box is the Final Fantasy 15 money-grabbing beast of horrific proportions that is so awful it may very well be the end of the series. Before I smash it and bury it, however; I will get it for my PS4 PRO. All in all this model is on it's way OUT- but this price for the ""king"" of consoles simply cannot be ignored. Sadly- the games do not follow the same pattern.

  Microsoft delivered on their promise. This bad boy is much more powerful than even the PS4 pro. Games look great in 4k HDR. The Xbox does true 4k with no need to checkerboard in most games. Forza 7 plays in 2160p60 HDR which is incredibly impressive for a 500 dollar console. If you want the best experience for a multiplatform game, the X is for you.I own a PS4 Pro as well, which now feels obsolete outside exclusives. You get your money's worth with the X since the 4k blu ray player is great as well.

  At this price we should all have high expectations, and overall this product is full of disappointing design flaws, errors, and ugly ads/content that can not be disabled.If you’re looking for an elegant product you can be proud to display on your living room display look elsewhere. The home screen is a disaster, by default not family-friendly. You can disable the gross cartoon T&A by setting the age filter (not very intuitive), but you can never disable all ads or remove the streaming channels or social network stuff that may be useless to you.The media remote that you have to purchase separately is a piece of junk. No Bluetooth, all black so it’s hard to find in a dark room, the battery cover pops off easily, and the volume controls over IR blaster only increment your A/V equipment one click at a time so you have to repeatedly press volume keys and can not hold them down. Soooo frustratingly stupid. Then there are bugs: The Console will randomly not sign in or connect to wi-fi requiring a manual restart and lots of waiting. Discs randomly will not play when inserted. Apps randomly get signed out (like plex), more waiting and frustration.These are unacceptable issues at this price point. I have an Apple TV 4K and it has none of this issues. Yes some 4K HDR games are only available on Xbox, but if you are expecting a quality user experience and a well-functioning media player, you will be very disappointed.

  Pre ordered this bad boy at the beginning of Sept.I was contemplating on getting the PS4 Pro for the upgraded VR visuals over my OG PS4 and new released games coming in 2018, but I decided not to bc I wanted to take full advantage of my 4k TV that I spent close to 2 grand on.Pros:-Gameplay visuals are absolutely stunning. AC: Orgins, The Witcher 3, COD WWII, and Halo 5 are the games that I've tried with true 4K. They look astounding and its jaw dropping. FIFA, NHL, and Madden all look good too, but I mainly play RPGs and shooters.-The size is so small and the console runs super quiet-Loading times in offline RPGs like the Witcher are drastically reduced.-Dashboard is smoother than my Day One XB1-No more power brick-4K blu-raymany more to go overCons:-Only 1TB... Halo is almost 100GB.. Buy an external hard drive if you intend on having close to a dozen games at once on this console-Still need a dang Kinect adapter that Microsoft recently discontinued...-Lack of exclusives on release, and it doesn't look like there will be too strong of a 2018 for Xbox either.... Sea of Thieves and State of Decay 2? Please.... PS4 is absolutely embarrassing Xbox in this regard.All in all, this thing is a BEAST. Other than exclusives, this is the best console on the planet. Looks like nothing will touch this until 2019-2020.

  So, I recently purchased an Xbox One X on launch day in November of last year and I wanted to share my thoughts on it. I came from an Xbox 360 and this guy is sooooooo much quieter. Mine can get pretty hot because it doesn't have as much ventilation around it but it never slows down because of that(It's gotten up to 110 degrees. I made sure it had ventilation too.) Gameplay is very smooth on it. I will not say it never has a hiccup because that's not true, but if it does it recovers within milliseconds. I love the layout of everything in the menu on the One X. Everything is relatively easy to find and navigate. Design wise, it's pretty basic with my only complaint being I wish they had another port for another wired controller like the original Xbox One. I'm pleased with the amount of games coming out that are ""One X Enhanced"" and that take advantage of it's power. I also love it coming with 1 TB of memory storage because you burn through that memory very quick with updates and downloading games on it. I have watched Blu-ray movies on it and it performs flawlessly too. Overall, I think this is an outstanding system that is great if you have a 4K TV. I can't speak for the PS4 Pro, but I personally love my One X and don't regret paying $500. It is worth every cent to me.

  Last Christmas, my parents bought my brothers and I a new console; the Xbox One X. Prior to this, I had been playing on an Xbox One S but the Xbox One X blew it out of the ballpark. Although it has a relatively high price tag, its 4k graphics and a wide variety of games/apps make up for the price.  The Xbox One X includes 4k graphics, which means there are 4 times the pixels as standard full HD. The higher resolution is a huge plus to buying this console. The Xbox One X GPU is a high-end graphics card by AMD. Due to these specs, the Xbox One X can run games at a higher frame rate than its competitor, the PS4 Pro. The increased framerate stands out in demanding games such as Forza Horizon and Halo 5.  The Xbox One X also includes a wide variety of games and apps to download. I would recommend purchasing an external hard drive for storage, for the games do take up a large amount of storage. Xbox has a wide variety of games and apps to choose from, ranging from MMO’s to RPG’s. It also has built-in 4k Blu ray, which the PS4 Pro does not currently have.  One thing that you might need to overcome is the price. Starting at around 499 dollars (at its release), it isn’t cheap. I have played many hours of all kinds of games and apps, and all this time has proven to me that all the cool and unique features on the Xbox One X make it worth every dollar. When your spending all this money, you deserve only the best, you really notice that with its fast loading speeds, faster than any other console.  Overall, the Xbox One X is outstanding for someone trying to take their gaming experience to a new level. The only thing that lowers my rating would be the high price that is hard to overcome. Thanks to massive updates, high frame rates, and fast loading speeds, the system will always be fresh. There are loads of games to play and accessories to upgrade your gaming experience.

  I purchased my Xbox One X last spring from a different retailer.  When it works, it's great.  However the other 80% of the time, it's been a huge headache.Things to keep in mind before purchasing:1. You must plug this console directly into an outlet (NOT a powerstrip).  Sure, many people don't do this, or even know about this.  However after MULTIPLE months of NUMEROUS calls to Microsoft, spending COUNTLESS hours on hold and on the phone with various ""experts"" in multiple countries, one thing they always mention is the fact that NOT plugging it directly into an outlet will cause the XBOX ONE X to run at 80% capacity.  That's right: If you have your XBOX ONE X plugged into a power strip, you're cheating yourself out of 20% of its power.  This information is readily available on all XBOX ONE X literature.2. This unit's ""Wi-Fi"" is either a running joke, or non-existent.  Buy an ethernet cable and hook your Xbox One X directly to your router.  The XBOX One X is terrible finding and staying connected to networks.  After a while, I got tired of doing a ""factory reset"" every day, just to access wireless functions (yes, that's the only way Microsoft employees could solve the problem).  My internet service is phenomenal and consistently strong/fast.  NONE of my other devices have even a small problem with my network.  My Switch, PS4, Xbox 360, and smart TV all work just fine. It's the Xbox One X that is flawed.In conclusion, only buy this console if you plan on plugging directly into an outlet, and you're able to connect it to the internet via an ethernet cable.  Otherwise, you're potentially setting yourself up for prolonged frustration.  I say ""potentially"" because I'm sure there are batches(?) of consoles out there that don't have these defects.  I'm sure there are plenty of people who own this console and it works just fine plugged into a powerstrip and it stays connected to the internet.  HOWEVER, there are MANY people out there with units like mine (google Xbox One X can't stay connected).I love this console when it works, however I'm not happy for having paid $500 for a faulty product which has caused so much frustration  Thankfully, it works fine for me now, but only because I use a ethernet cable.  I should also point out that Microsoft's customer service has been gracious enough to provide 6 months of Xbox Live for all the trouble.

  Just a quick heads up to anyone buying this device. This is NOT the Series X this is the Xbox One X, the upgraded version of the Xbox One console which came out in 2013.You want to get the Xbox Series X (Note there's no ""one"" mentioned anywhere).In addition, Xbox Series S will NOT play enhanced versions of Xbox One games, the Xbox Series X will.

  So far, I love it. Like my PS4 Pro, games look much much better. Games seem to load faster too. I just hope MS takes advantage of the power by bringing some great exclusives like Sony has been doing. I had a white original xbox console. I loved it but it's back in it's box and will probably never be played again as long as I have the X. Once you play the X you never go back. If you are on the fence, all I can say is all my hopes of what the console could do have been met and I have no regrets upgrading. ( VR was a promise of MS back in the unveiling of the X and they have since declared that VR is not coming to the console-huge let down for me- I love my PSVR)I regret not buying it at launch. I waited till June 2018 to buy one. The list of xbox one X enhanced games continues to grow and the difference is most of the time very substantial.  I hope I get 2 or 3 years out of it before the next generation of xbox comes out.

  My Xbox1X is a lemon. Was working fine first 3 months, then it started having freezing issues. Tried everything to fix it. Yup, did a full reset. Still freezing and OS running to a crawl. Now its pretty much inoperable. Over $500 and now I'm regetting having faith in Microsoft. Should just get a PC and just stick to PS4 or Sony consoles because Microsoft products just suck. I'm sick and tired of their products breaking down. Reminds me of the ""red ring of death"" days. XBOX SUCKS. STICK WITH SONY. PS never have this many issues.

  After contemplating buying a PS4 pro for months despite bad reviews of the pro I finally was able to preorder this sucker in August 2017. The thing runs every game faster, in higher resolution and at a smoother visual fidelity, totally worth the $500, considering a solid gaming PC is almost $2000 that can run 4K games smoothly this thing is a steal, I actually ended up getting a PS4 pro as well and the one X is more powerful, quieter and smaller! Crazy how wel designed it is my PS4 pro kicks out heat and the fan makes a ton of noise while the one X is nearly silent.

  I truly love this new box.  Was a little apprehensive to get one, so many negative fanboys.  However, I still had several games I left behind when I went from my X360 to PS4.  I feel back at home on the Xbox One X (X1X).  I had received a TCL 4K Roku TV over Christmas and wanted to pair it with something high-end and the X1X fulfilled that in every way.  I am amazed by its power and it is completely silent so far whether gaming or watching a 4K Blu-Ray.  I just love it.  I started play the Sea of Thieves Beta and it is a blast.  Plan to go SoT, State of Decay 2, and Crackdown 3 if it comes out soon.  I also have begun using Game Pass.  I love the service and it matches well with the X1X.  If you are looking for a silent high-end media and gaming system, you cannot go wrong here.

It's a nice machine if (AND ONLY IF) you have a 4k tv (WITH HDR!!!!!) which I have but its not worth it. Yes you will notice a difference in picture quality but NOT 500 BUCKS WORTH...All the effort they put into the Xbox one X should have been put into their NEXT GENERATION CONSOLE...ONLY buy this if you don't currently own an Xbox...hope this helps.

  I purchased my Xbox One X at Walmart, since they gave me the price match. Though I am pleased overall, I have become extremely annoyed that I consistently and daily lose controller pairing with the X console. At first I thought I just hadn’t paired them correctly, so I paired all four controllers again, and yes, I still lose pairing. This is not something that ever occurred with my Xbox One “Day One Edition”. That said, I believe there’s a software issue that needs to be pushed through to remedy this problem.I also checked online about this issue, and it appears that others have complained of this same problem.

  I was really excited for this new console, but I've had several issues that have yet to be fixed by either updates or support. The first being the HDMI port to the TV seems to be faulty. At random, the output will flash or disconnect entirely. This is not a cabling or TV issue, as I've swapped new cables and bought a new TV since my Xbox purchase. Additionally, some of my games have experienced major bugs since the first One X updates came through, the worst being Forza 3 Horizons. When I launch the game, certain menus take an extremely long time to load, or never launch properly at all. When I attempt to join races, the game crashes. Unistalling/reinstalling the game doesn't resolve the issue. I've owned Xboxes from each generation and never encountered any issues like this.

  First off I started out on the Playstation as a young Marine in 95 but as a convert to the Xbox this was the console we should have got on instead of the Xboner. I did not purchase mine through Amazon but decided to take a drive into Houston to pick mine up at a Gamestop and have enjoyed every minute of ditching my original Xbone i'm currently playing on a 1080p tv and enjoying the vast improvement of many of my older games like the Witcher 3 and others I have yet to decide if I want to make the jump to a 4k as I see no need to. I did have one instance of a power issue but I only had to unplug my Xbox one X from the wall for a few seconds and plug it back in I tend to leave my system in low power with a fast turn on and decided to full shutdown when not in use other than that the console runs great.

  I had swore off Xbox for life after the myriad of problems I had with my Xbox 360. I was a day 1 owner, and I received the red ring of death. Microsoft had sent me about 3 refurbished units that all eventually did the same thing before my warranty expired. I had a log of probably 40 games that were rendered useless as I was NOT going to pay them to send me yet another Refurbished unit. I thought I was done with them for good, and I've been enjoying my PS3 and PS4 since. During Christmas of 2017 however there was a sweet deal on an Xbox One S with Forza Horizon 3, so I gave in and gave them another chance. Besides a left trigger that was slightly wobbly and loose on the controller I was so impressed with the S that upgrading to the X was a no brainer when I got my 4K TV. I bought mine through Gamestop. I was very happy initially with the way games ran, and looked. The problem was that the internet kept disconnecting from the Xbox. I was using a wired ethernet connection, had the quick start mode enabled etc...., but when signing back on after putting the console to sleep I noticed downloads would be paused from the prior night, and not downloaded like I expected. After looking in to my router settings I found that the Xbox was doing a random total disconnect from my internet after I put it to sleep. Also since the Xbox was disconnecting from the Internet while in quick start mode it wouldn't start up with the Xbox app on my phone either. The problem seemed to be remedied by using a wireless connection, but I wanted to use wired. I finally took it back to gamestop citing what I assume to be an issue with the ethernet port, and they gave me another one. This second unit I'm happy to report is awesome, runs flawlessly, and has none of those problems with disconnecting from the internet thus far. The only issue with this unit is that the controller that came with this one is not quite seamed/fused together near the left trigger button, and I can tell it's a little loose there. It's not a big deal, and the controller works fine, but it is just another example that Xbox still has some quality control issues they need to sort out. When buying any of their products be very thorough in checking that EVERYTHING works as advertised. 3 different units from 2 different vendors, and I've had small problems with each. If you can snag one that is in complete working order it is an amazing console. If it weren't for these ridiculous quality control issues, and the sluggish speed of the Microsoft store through the console I would have given it 5 stars.

  It IS the best console ever made (to date).PROS:- PROCESSORX technically has the best hardware outside of a PC. That's why you're here. It's solid, steady, runs silent most of the time. Mine is used routinely and doesn't overheat.- HD4K streaming, 4K gaming, UHDs (PS4 CANNOT play them), HDR, HD Enhanced titles, Dolby vision, Dolby Atmos (this was the first device to support Atmos to my knowledge or at least it was the first one on the Dobly Atmos site anyway).- HDMI inHDMI in allows you to view another device on your Xbox One. Some use this to add cable boxes, external OTA tuners or other devices. Theoretically you could view an Xbox 360, PS4 or anything that outputs a signal via HDMI (not sure how well that'd work but it might be possible...could you connect ANOTHER Xbox One into an Xbox One and have Xbox One-ception?) I haven't had a cable subscription in years but I love the way the Xbox One will show your channel line-up with cable, satellite or OTA and I love that it auto-plays in a little window while scrolling through the lineup. I do have an antenna and the local channel line up is there...- INSTALLEase of installing, moving titles. If purchased digitally, games automatically show in your queue and auto install if desired. You can install a game digitally from a 1 Xbox to another Xbox (generally faster than doing so by downloading) via a network install. Hide or unhide titles from your ""ready to install"" area if desired. Sort titles by size, use, alphabetical...Games update themselves automatically.- HOME XBOXIf you have 2 or more Xboxes, you can play your stuff on 1 Xbox and another person can play your stuff on the ""home"" Xbox at the same time having access to the same game library and same licenses meaning you won't have to buy them twice...- ACCOUNT-BASEDCloud saves. You can log into any Xbox One anywhere (as long as it has an internet connection), download your stuff (if it isn't already there) and play whatever it is, wherever you are...This is a major improvement over prior generations. No more carrying around a save file or hard drive...If a game is lost or hard drive dies, your saves are still there.- PREVIEW PROGRAMInsider, preview program, skip ahead, preview new features faster (if you can get approved for it).- MUSICPlay music with an app while playing a game and control volume of each.- BACKWARD COMPATIBILITYSelect Xbox 360 and Xbox Original title backward compatibility (many/most of the good games are there). There are so many 360 compat titles that everyone in the house has completely abandoned the 360.- GAME PASSGold, Game Pass and Ultimate. Gold gets you 4 games per month now - that'd be roughly 50/yr (they're not all great of course but some are). Game Pass gets you over 100+ games (possibly over 200 by the time you read this). You could upgrade Gold or Game Pass to Ultimate for $1 during E3 2019 and have access to over 100+ games for the same amount of time you have Gold. Have Gold for 3 years? You now have Game Pass for 3 years for $1. This was an insane deal. When Gears5 comes out you play it free. When Halo6 comes out you play it free. And so on. Game Pass will soon come to PC.- COMMUNITIESGroups, Looking for groups, communities to find people who play the same things you do.- ACHIEVEMENTSAchievement system improvements, diamond (rare) achievements, achievement progress, weekly or monthly achievements, etc...- VIDEO CAPTUREEditing and uploading screenshots, videos is improved, fast (but where you can upload them is still lacking).- MIXERMS's commitment to Mixer in the face of Amazon's endless money to support Twitch is admirable. Mixer doesn't have the Twitch brand name cache, but it appears to work well...- CROSS-PLAYImproved 3rd party platform experiences. Xbox / Windows crossover -- some Xbox games you purchase can be played on a PC and with an Xbox controller if desired. Xbox app appearing on Nintendo store, crossover play with other platforms on select titles. Xbox will now support GOG, Steam, others...- NEW DEVSSerious acquisitions of very good developers like Obsidian (Fallout), DoubleFine, Compulsion, etc. Acquisitions of titles like Gears seem obvious...- CONTROLLERThe new Xbox One controller with bluetooth and headphone jack is basically the standard controller in the gaming industry because it's just that good - it's solid. They even put rumblers in the triggers. My only complaint is it's hard to dissemble and mod (there are 2 boards and some of the things you would want to remove - you can't easily).- COOL APPSKodi is pretty awesome and the fact that those devs are trying to keep the app working on Xbox One is wonderful.- LEADERSHIPPhil Spensor and Major Nelson are great guys. Actual gamers. They know what they're doing.-----CONS:- SNAPRemoval of ""snap"" (picture in picture or app in app) feature. This was definitely a cool feature.- EXCLUSIVESMany exclusives have been slow, lacking, meh or disappointing this console generation, e.g. Crackdown. They made a big deal about Crackdown (a game most of us had fun with but had forgotten about). When it was released, it was just okay...Nothing to write home about. Still, many of the best titles are going to be multi-platform anyway. Red Dead Redemption 2 was probably the best title of 2018 and it will probably look and play best on Xbox One X.- SOCIAL MEDIADeeper social media integration still has a little bit to catch up (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, etc).- FORUMThe old Xbox forum was more of a community reddit-like experience and it's virtually dead now. Most people don't use the forum (does it even exist at all?) and go to individual developer/publisher sites instead...- HDRThe way some apps use HDR (Netflix) has been chaotic and confusing (this appears to be Netflix's fault).- SSDLack of a sku with internal SSD (this would obviously increase the price of the console so I understand why they haven't done it this generation).- KINECTThis doesn't really apply to the newer Xbox One models anymore but the initial force bundling of Kinect was a cost bungle on Don Mattrick's part. MS's complete abandoning of the device years later feels wimpy. All you need is 1 killer app to breathe life into the device.-----OTHER NOTES:If you're trying to decide between Xbox One S or X, I can tell you as someone who uses both constantly, yes the S will be much cheaper but it feels incredibly slow and sluggish compared the the X. I'd say IF you are someone who games causally, intermittently (not daily), has 30 or less games, the S should be fine for you. BUT if you're more of a power user, pick the X and feel all those teraflops all over your face. And the PC master race? Comb the cheetos our of your neckbeard. You already feel superior so what are you doing here with us console babies?

  It pains me to say, after being possibly the biggest Xbox 360 fanboy of all time, I have probably never regretted any single purchase in my life as much as my Xbox One console. I call it the Netfli-X-Box, because that's all it's good for. Microsoft was so focused on turning it into a glorified cable box with Skype and ESPN, (because video game nerds care so much about televised sports that they wouldn't have cable if not for their Xbox?) that they forgot to make any good games for their game console.Scrolling through the overly stuffed games library, you will be hard pressed to find anything that is not either A: A side scrolling platformer, B: A topdown shooter, C: A walking simulator puzzle game, D: A retro through back so the lack of pixels is excusable, or D: A mainly text-based adventure game. It's like Team Xbox is trying to bring back PC gaming circa 1998 so they could be even lazier when designing their games. Of course, that would be giving them far too much credit, because they aren't trying to design almost any games at all.That's right, disguised as a ""platform for indie developers pitch"" Microsoft has passed off almost all of their consoles game production to inexperienced small studios and it shows SO MUCH, like diarrhea in a wedding dress after a few bad hors d'oeuvres. I mean, sure, it's fine to give a few indie developers a break, even though the total lack of quality control leaves you with a jumbled mess of practically carbon copy garbage all over the games library, but you are a game production company, you have to produce games for your console too. Most games, even on the oh-so-powerful Xbox One X, look bad for an original Xbox game, this is what happens when you leave all the game making to the literal amateurs and cancel the only decent looking exclusive you've ever had for the dumbest reasons I've ever heard (R.I.P. Scalebound).In summary, if they're not going to put any effort into it, don't put your money into it. It is literally pointless to own an Xbox One at this point in time, added X or otherwise, because there are NO GAMES on this GAME CONSOLE. At least barely any that aren't already playable with higher fidelity and better frame rates on other consoles with countless more exclusives of their own whereas I struggle to think of almost any Xbox exclusives that weren't extremely underwhelming. I gave it a shot Microsoft, I really did, you kept getting your fans hopes up and sending them straight back down to rock bottom. But hey, at least you can play hundreds of games you can also probably play on literally any modern smartphone (for a quarter of the price on them) with barely better resolution on a big, immovable block the size of 4 complete hardcover collectors editions of the Lord of the Rings trilogy lined up next to each other, taking up too much space for too much money for too little reason.Well, at least I can still watch my streaming services with slightly more ease of typing than my Apple TV, even though they constantly crash because Microsoft couldn't even get the completely extraneous things to the purpose of the product right that they wasted all of their money on, apparently leaving little to none for the whole point, the GAMES. 2 out of 5 for the two things it's good at, being a big ugly coaster and a decent rig for a good ol' Netflix and chill session, what an amazing achievement...

  Fresh out of the box was defective. It wouldn't eject the disk we put in. It sounded like it was eating the disk. Once we got half of the disk out using the manual eject button, we had to pry the disk out of the drive slot, and the system wouldn't take any more disks without it sounding like it was going to tear it apart. Took it to a Microsoft service store and they said it seemed like it was either tampered with or dropped. 350 bucks and hours wasted. And to top it all off, when my wife went to the amazon store to return it, they gave her a hard time and tried to tell her she couldn't return it even though I just scheduled a return to the store... I've never been so frustrated with the lack of care and customer service with amazon ever.

  Let me be clear here.  For the 2 hours i had the xbox one x up and running i was in love.  It's sleek, heavy and just hypnotic in some ways to look at.  This is the system that my original xbox one, should have been.  I took it out of its package, also the packaging felt more like an apple or google product than the last three xbox, xbox 360 and xbox one have felt like.I was in love from the moment i pulled it out of the box.  Plugged it in, and downloaded the mandatory day one update, no problems whatsoever.I had moved my original xbox (OX)  one to the main tv, as I wanted to have it act as a bluray player and streaming box for when the wife and I want to watch tv on it.To my surprise, as i logged into my fancy new console, my OX would log out.  Perplexed and with a rising sense of panic on just spending $500 on a system that would be unusable in my home's configuration, I went online to figure out what was happening.As it turns out, MS doesn't allow a person to use one xbox live membership in two locations at once.  Since this was my house i thought surely i can game, while the wife watches netflix on my OX, using my gold to link it.  I was wrong.Now i have a magnificent new console, that costs $500, and after searching through online articles for an hour I realized the truth.  I would need to return one system or the other, or buy another xbox live gold membership.There is something called ""home"" xbox which MS allows you to do, but this did not fit my needs.  In turn i sent my system back.  I hope someone gets it on a warehouse deal, as its a great system, and i want it back badly.  However i'm not willing to throw out, sell my OX (which runs fine), or pay another $60 for a mostly unused gold membership.Once the OX goes i'll def get another X, there's no question however, MS needs to figure this situation out.  Its ridiculous.

  I'm on my second X Box One in three years and now I will need to pay to have this one fixed.  Great gaming system but it must be made cheaply.  I am switching to PlayStation 4 because I hear they are more reliable.  I love my X Box but I refuse to pay $139 every other year to have it fixed.  BTW, if you want to speak to customer service, you can't.  The only contact you have is via a program.  I actually prefer to speak to a human vice scrolling for help from one screen to the next.  If I had know that you can't talk to customer service I WOULD NEVER have bought the unit.

  We bought this JAN-11-2018 from Amazon as NEW. We got it. It looked new, all sealed up and ready to go. Set it up, went through the wizard all is good.Now I was thinking I really need to watch Star Trek: Discovery. So I downloaded the CBS App. I was surprised the first episode was free. Which was great, I get it. They want to make sure you are on board with the series before you buy.Then the 2nd episode played. Then the third, and by the 4th. I was googling, ""Free Star Trek Discovery Weekend?"" Finally I went to my settings in the app. There is someone logged in as, ""BEN M."" limited commercial package.So contact XBOX. They say Amazon sold you a used XBOX. They said Contact them and CBS. CBS Says, you for sure got a linked xbox to a streaming account. It was a used XBOX. Amazon said, sorry for your troubles here is 30% off the purchase price.The real issue is Amazon is selling new PRIME XBOX ONE X Consoles as new but they are used.Thanks Ben M. whomever you are. I see you like Big Brother and Big Bang Theory sorry for freaking you out with all my recently watched shows.

  I have been really disappointed with the X Box One X. I have changed from the PS to X Box and it's been a really bad purchase especially for the money that you pay for it. First of all, when I bought it, I realized that after a few weeks there were two other accounts already set up on this which means that it is likely this was not a brand new console even though I ordered a brand new one from Amazon. I am going to contact them about this but this is unacceptable!I've had the console about 6 weeks now and it doesn't even work anymore. It constantly just freezes on me, I have even reset it to it's factory conditions and gone through a few things to try and fix it. Once I did eventually do it, I installed the game again and it just keeps coming it with different errors.I think this is just a really poor design and a waste of money. I really would not recommend anyone to buy the X Box One X, you will just get frustrated with it and it won't work for you.There isn't even anywhere on Microsoft where I can complain about this.

  So backstory: I am an avid gamer, and have been gaming since OG Xbox. I currently pair this with a 55 inch 4k t.v.I have had every gen XBox/Playstation. I went through original XBox to 360, and from 360 to original XBox 1, to a One S when we first bought our 4k t.v. in 2016, to the X.This gen each xbox traded up, my 360 elite went to get the Xbox One, which went to get the S, which went to get the X- to mitigate cost of investment. Trading in my S netted me the X for approx $235, a deal I couldn't pass up.To be frank, the reviews speak volumes of this XBox and they are no lie. Paired next to the PS4 Pro, the XBox outshines in gaming and doubles for family media like Netflix, blu ray 4k movies, etc.Honestly? I will be keeping the One X the same as we kept our original XBox. It will not be getting traded in for next generation. It stands testament to the quality that can exist in the console space, which isn't always spectacular. The One X is a gem of a system, and wholeheartedly earns the praise it has right now.One issue to note for planned long term ownership: Microsoft skimped on the heat paste utilized for the on board chip. It dries out, fast! It isn't a forefront issie yet but will eventually be as systems overheat over long term use. That being said? I have ran ours daily for 8 monthes so far no issue- and it gets heavy use at our household. I thuroughly expect to have to open the system up at some point in the next year to upgrade/renew the heat paste, and this will be an issue for many day 1 release consoles as well. Not too bad if you are tech savvy, and if not- prepare for the investment to have a computer repair shop do it for you, or Microsoft. It is the key to longevity of the X, and its sole weakness other than in time it won't be the fancy new car on the block anymore.One thing I will say is it will stand testament to the quality of gaming for this generation, and is worth a spot paired to any 4k t.v. for XBox and non Xbox gamers alike. If you are not avide on XBox? This is the console to win your heart over!

  I purchased the Xbox One X Gold Rush Edition about 4 days ago and...I'm disappointed. I am a true tech nerd and love video games (PC and Console) and I am disgusted that Microsoft would use such cheap HDD's paired with actual decent processing power. Rendering in 4k or even 1440p for games like Battlefield V, Battlefield 1, The Division, ESO, and Final Fantasy XV are literally made retarded by the Seagate HDD they've installed. It takes several seconds after the fact for textures and various details to appear in game. Not to mention the dried out thermal paste I found on the processor. The thermal pads weren't even aligned entirely over the RAM! It looked like a 8yo got ahold of an applicator of compound and had some fun. I properly cloned a 2tb SSD in place of the HDD and it made a godly world of difference. It went from 65 seconds to load FFXV to 21 seconds after the swap. Not to mention rendering is immediate.This hurts me Microsoft. I'm sticking to PC from now on.

  Unimpressed.I pre-ordered this thing directly from Microsoft. It's a monster they said. Well, yes it is, in the sense that not a day goes by that something doesn't work. Literally every day it stops working and has to be restarted. The biggest problem is media related apps rarely work without restarting the box. Try to open one, it just hangs, throws an error code, and then tells you to restart. I've wiped the machine, reinstalled everything, etc., multiple times, yet the problem persists. I've reported it to Microsoft numerous times, to no avail.It's pretty obvious Microsoft has given up on the entertainment side of Xbox outside of gaming itself. My $30 Fire stick wipes the floor with the Xbox.On the gaming side of things I honestly don't notice much of a difference. I even upgraded my old plasma to an OLED and from my viewing distance it makes no material difference.This monster doesn't live up to the hype or the price tag.

  Update: Microsoft store gave me the price I was expecting when I went to return the unit, so although still annoyed, I am no longer pissed off.I paired the One X with a 75"" Samsung QLED 6 series I purchased on Amazon. The net effect is impressive, met my high expectations. Enhanced graphics are noticeably better, games in 4 k look slightly more detailed even after stretching from the 55"" tv I am accustomed to, to 75"". Effects like rolling for and stuff like that look thicker and more real. 4 player split screen Rocket League is like having 4 × 37 inch 1080 screens on one tv, and feels graphically equivalent to powering each screen with its own original XBOX one. My son reports that spawned creatures in subnotica look so much better on x vs original that they are practically unrecognizable. Netflix in 4K is breathtaking. As an unexpected bonus, the TV remote controls the Xbox, which is fantastic.Original review: I made the mistake of dealing directly with the Microsoft store on black friday where I was misled into paying full price for a console that everybody, including microsoft, had on sale for $100 less that day. Unfortunately, the store didn't list any prices and I failed to realize that the Microsoft store was in the business of gouging its walk in customers on Black Friday. As soon as I noticed that I had paid more than the advertised price, I called Microsoft to get it fixed. I found myself dealing with a hapless call center employee who wore their powerlesness to help me like a shield.

  With the obvious caveat that you need to have a 4K HDR-capable TV to see the difference, the Xbox One is amazing and I wish I hadn't dithered on my decision to get one for so long. I have a high-end PC (using a GTX 1070 8 GB version) and while the technical performance isn't quite as good since it'd be impossible to expect a console to do that, this is the closest any console has ever come to any PC I've ever had. The resolution from 1080p to 4k is noticeable but not as dramatic as, say, the jump from SD to 1080i/p was but what really makes the difference is HDR. The Forza games in particular are stunning, real life doesn't even look that good. Just about all the AAA releases coming out now are ""Enhanced"" (meaning they are in native 4k with HDR), and Microsoft has made a good faith effort to upgrade all its big first party titles to 4K and work with publishers to do so as well.

  My first console and I really like it. It was heavier than I thought when I got it. I like how simple the design is and am 1000% thankful it is a 1TB because holy crap games take up a lot of space! I only have maybe 5 on there and that plus the pre-installed software I'm already down to 660 gigs of space left. I'm not sure how normal it is to have that much space taken up from games and software.The xbox one x lets you do so many other things with the apps like Netflix, HULU, Crunchyroll...you can watch practically anything. I wish they had a wider variety of free games and it's confusing with the Game Pass and Live Gold but it is a great machine. I use it a lot and am really pleased with it.

  Wow is all I have to say.  Microsoft really did it right with this system.  The upgrade from Xbox to the One X was extremely easy in terms of transferring games through the network and moving over your system settings.  The graphics in 4k are beautiful.  I have only sampled a bit so far.  But Call of Duty Infinite Warfare and The Witcher are just really really nice looking.  Looking forward to seeing Destiny 2 and Rise of the Tomb Raider.  If you are thinking about the upgrade and you enjoy awesome visuals (have 4k tv) and quick load times, I highly recommend.  Now bring on the games Microsoft.  We need you to go all-in on some AAA titles and exclusives in 2018.  Also looking forward to seeing your AR/VR.

  The idea is great but.....significant menu lag, often requires multiple controller presses to get  the item selected. Oddly the startup screen only says ""xbox one"" not ""xbox one X"". And takes an abnormaly long time The internal hard drive seems to be an older cheaper one it grinds and slow loading. Still no function to turn tv on through hdmi, that Sony has had for years. Installed games have abnormally long load and starting times. It took 5 minutes to start Fallout 4. The original xbox is faster, tested them side by side. Save the cash.

  EVERYTHING AS PROMISED. A fantastic system. No problems, no lag, no crash, no noise, no heat to the touch after hours of play. Storage is great also, more than enough for most folks, I have 15 full games on there at 80% full. Get an external hard drive if you want...or just delete some games when things start to get more full than you like (you don't need all those arcade and 360 titles on there now anyway)No more power block too. Design is so nice and simplified. Interface is easy and simple to navigate to find what you need. Simple black and can be put on its side with a stand (sold separately).I've been an Xbox user since OG Xbox and this is the most forward thinking console they've ever put out. It needs to be like this from here on out; this sets the bar pretty high.also you can still plug other inout sources into the Xbox like the big block one...I have my Nintendo classic mini edition plugged in so I can switch to some old school without changing input source on my TV.Did I also mention there's Kodi now too?Looks great even on my 55"" 1080p LED.I will be upgrading to 4kTV in the next couple years so I can't wait for things to look even better.All together I'm happy to have a future proof console for the next several years.Now all Xbox needs is............titlessssss........too much to ask?

  Hard to say where to start. I try to watch a Blu-ray and it crashes. My Xbox frequently loses signal with the wireless controllers. My Xbox frequently loses my video settings. One second my 4K tv is going well and my video or my audio goes away. And when I’ve needed assistance from Xbox there’s no documented history so you start with square one when troubleshooting. I was even told by Xbox that it’s a gaming system not a Blu-ray player. Then how can they call it a full entertainment system? Not to mention 1tb doesn’t hold more than 4 games. You’re gonna need an 6tb or higher external or you’ll be deleting games left and right.

  Terrible. Absolutely intolerable. The console has had issues since the very first week of ownership. I believe it is an issue with a faulty hard drive. Constantly makes me do factory resets and delete my save data just to work for a day or two at most. I was inspired to write this review because I've literally spent the last hour desperately trying to get my console to work long enough to play For Honor with friends. I bought an external hard drive to put my games on just so I could speed up the process by not actually deleting my games. The ""terabyte"" hard drive can't hold any games because of these issues, so I would have been forced to buy an external anyway.I've been an Xbox user for a decade now. This problem? This encouraged me to make  the switch to PC. The only things keeping me resuscitating this brick with wishful thinking and broken dreams every day are my friends that don't have PC's yet, the fact that I'm extremely close to 100,000 gamerscore, the fact that I foolishly bought Cyberpunk 2077 and want to see if the Xbox will hold out to launch, and that I'm unwilling to do the grind for all my stuff on  PC right now.I will never buy another Xbox console at full price. This experience has burned me too much. I may never buy an Xbox console again.What makes matter worse is that there are no great solutions to my problem. I've tried looking my issue up online and Microsoft emplyees' official answer to the problem has essentially been, ""have you dang old tried turning that thing off and on again?"" Why yes, I have! In fact- I've moved my chair right next to my Xbox so it's easier to do so! Sending the Xbox for potential repair also isn't an option at the moment since there's a slightly worrying pandemic affecting the world and making money rather tight.The Error messages I get that are listed are but a few of the ones I get. Those are just the pictures I've taken. I understand that the ""Preparing Console"" message doesn't mean anything on its own, but please trust in me when I say that I've done at least five factory resets in the last hour alone.Just get a PC so that you can listen to music while playing games and talking to your friends all at the same time. I bought a SkyTech Gaming PC for around $730 (including three year warranty) that has yet to give me issues.

  This is the most polished console, either PlayStation or Xbox, Ive ever had in terms of performance, design, and never freezing or glitching. It is truly a powerhouse and I can tell a difference even on my 1080p tv. Supersampling really does work. I think I would have trouble going back to any other system. Yes it’s a premium console so it costs more, but if you can afford it the console is worth the price tag.

  Last Black Friday amazon dropped the battlefield one s to $349.It included 1tb and the battlefield 1 digital download.I already owned the PS4 version of this game so I assumed I’d just let it sit there.But then I decided to try it.Normally I liked the physical games and not downloads but I started liking the feel of the controller more and more.Eventually I started playing battlefield more on the Xbox than any other game on my ps4.For 6 months my ps4 collected dust.I told myself I’d never upgrade to the “Scorpio”.But around Super Bowl season I bought a 4k tv.Then I saw what forza 7 looked like in 4k.Then I saw that there were more of my favorite games getting enhanced patches.Bought the Xbox one x...now I don’t play anything else.Just get it already lol

I am really upset and disappointed on how professional amazon is working right now. I would expect this from eBay but not on Amazon.

  It’s good and satisfying. What microsoft promised,and it looks great on my 4k tv. However,there are a few ignorant fanboys(I won’t name names) that say a 2000 dollar pc can’t match this. That,is wrong. A $750 Gaming PC can outmatch this in hardware and other things. I bought this mainly for my couch gaming/home theatre. I just wanted to point out some misleading people in the reviews. If you’re debating on wether you should buy this or buy a better pc in terms of hardware for just a bit more money,then get a pc. You want a simple console for home theatre and couch games? Get this. Don’t let the ignorant fanboys choose your decisions.

  If you are a fan of xbox then buy it. I hesitated for a while because of the price and because i already owned and xbox one s and ps4 pro but i finally decided to buy it and do not regret it. The games look a bit better then they do on the pro and it runs quietly. With the power that is packed in this system, it should remain relevant longer than the playstation 4 pro.

  Austin LanphierAppraisal Assignment1/31/18English 302The Xbox one X is the most modern Xbox gaming system. If you have the right entertainment systems, it can offer some of the best game play experiences. It has a lot new features which offer faster speed, better cooling, and higher resolution than any of its predecessor, however, with all the gaming systems out there it is important to ask yourself if the Xbox one X is worth the extra money.Questions to ask before buying your game system.1) How much are you willing to spend?2) How often will you use the gaming system?3) Do you have other friends with the gaming system and if you want to play online do they also play online?4) Are there any games that you want which are specific to a certain console?5) Is the gaming system best supported by your current T.V. and if not would you be willing to upgrade?In my opinion the Xbox one X is the best gaming system around, but it may not be the best option for everyone. There are other options which will save you a lot of money, get you the same games, and still offer an impressive gameplay experience.The perfect customer for an Xbox one X would ideally,1) Have a 4k T.V. -If you do not have a 4K T.V. an Xbox one S may be the best option.2) Plan on playing games over 7-8 hours each week3) Play games online frequently4) Be willing to spend over $600 initially for the console as well as some game I use my Xbox around 9-10 hours each week and play a lot of games online and I have a 4k T.V. so I think that the one X was a good purchase for me and worth the extra money. It is really great for online playing since it does not lag as much as a one S would, for games that I am not playing online I do not see a huge difference between mine and my friends one S.If you play games less frequently, or are just short on cash then the Xbox one S still offers the same games and has a much cheaper price tag. The visual experience of an Xbox one S will also be the same as an Xbox one X unless you have a 4K T.V., the biggest downfall in my opinion would be the slower processor speeds. For anyone who is looking for the best gaming experience around, you cannot go wrong with the Xbox one X. I would be happy to recommend this product to anyone!

  I dropped nearly a grand on the system games and 4k movies.  The controller syncs with the system for about two minutes and then disconnects.  I cannot play any games and when I watch movies I have to hold down on the power button on the controller to get it to connect again so I can pause or whatever.  How completely frustrating and irresponsible of Microsoft.

  Awesome experiences. Just plugged in my external hard drive and had everything ready to go. Many enhanced games that are distracting to play because they look so damn sharp. Even benefits all the non enhanced games with faster load times, more stable gameplay, increased resolutions if games use dynamic scaling, and increased sharpness from AA. System looks and runs great. Happy as heck to be getting the most of my 4K HDR TV. A no brainer for anyone trying to maximize  the content available for 4K TVs.

  Product is advertised as a 4K disc player. Unlike other 4K players it does NOT let you play Blu Ray or 4K discs unless you first create an account to give Xbox all your info, then you have to download an app called Blu-Ray Player. I've never heard of any Blu-Ray player requiring you to download an app, so I assume the purposes must be to track all the consumer's data as well as send more marketing bombardments. It's cumbersome to use, keeps freezing, just making a mistake logging in can trap you in loops where it won't recognize passcodes. Game aspect functions satisfactorily. But definitely NOT worth $500. If it was priced at $150 I'd probably give it 4 or 5 stars. But at $500 there shouldn't be any headaches.

  The Xbox X is a powerhouse. Coupled with my 70 inch 4K Smart TV it allows me to have 4K player and a 4K gaming device in one along with the other streaming apps you can download on it. One thing i did notice is the weight the Xbox X has. This thing doesn't feel cheap nor is cheap. Thus - making it an investment that you won't regret having in your entertainment setup.

  Bought an xbox one x and within a week all it could handle doing without shutting itself off is play a game. It shuts off when I; load a new game, click on the store, open my games and apps, idle for 5 minutes, sign in other accounts, and open a video app. If those things are important to you buy anything else!

  Admittedly, I don’t spend much time on games like I used to, but boy was I excited to get my hands on the latest and greatest! After a few months with it, I have fully come to terms with my buyer’s remorse. I should have bought the PlayStation 4 Pro for the more reasonable price and the exclusive games. Sony is an electronics company AND a major entertainment company. That should have been my first indication. Microsoft is a company that makes money selling licenses for clunky software. To each their own I guess, so if you like paying a monthly subscription fee for Microsoft Office you might love the Xbox One X.This thing is a big dumb ad machine—an ad machine that for $500 doesn’t even come with a rechargeable controller (AA batteries out the box like a boss). It has the most processing power on the market and it uses all that processing power to market. The upsells are endless. I paid way too much for this thing to play games, stop putting me through the timeshare pitch (that’s right, they sell videogames with the same terms of use as vacation property in Myrtle Beach—Pay only X dollars and get this game two weeks out of every year!).Review must update...Which brings me to the interface. The interface is like Times Square on a hot summer day complete with building sized ads and naked cowboys begging for change. The interface is terrible. If I put a disk in, I want to game. I don’t want to unintuitively wade through a teen bro’s digital stream of consciousness.Playing games isn’t great and it isn’t nearly as simple as it should be. On a number of occasions when I’ve tried to just sit and play a game this thing either needed to update the system or the game or it wasn’t connected to the internet so I couldn’t play (even in single player offline mode). The controller disconnects often in the middle of use. And this thing eats my household bandwidth to update even when I’m not using it. My kids don’t even like it.The Xbox One X is a Mclaren super car without a steering wheel. Don’t expect to ever just take it out for a spin and be ready for high ownership costs.

  What you need to know.1. Quiet. It's so quiet. I love this fact. Much quieter than my Pro PS4.2. Cool. After hours of gameplay and varied use not one part of the 1X is even warm to the touch. This speaks to a quality build.3. Why not 5 stars? I believe for $500 MS should've included it's elite controller for their elite system.I won mine from Mtn Dews every60seconds promotion.

  When somebody is buying a console they should consider purchasing an Xbox One X. Its native 4k and HDR support make it the best console in hardware terms. As well as it includes great benefits for Xbox Live Gold members. Additionally, the Xbox One has great games, furthermore, great backwards compatibility. For us nostalgia fans it makes it even great.

  We bought an xbox 1 only to find out that in order to play fortnite, you need to spend 10 dollars a month for the game pass, then after it updated you need to spend another 10 dollars a month for the gold pass. My 10 year old son spent his own birthdat money to upgrade to the game pass so he could play fortnite now since it upgraded and they want more money ( an extra 10 dollars a month) he is just out that money.We are getting rid of this piece of crap and buying the PS4, it doesn't charge you money to play its games.

  I can't possibly ever say how bad this console is. I wouldn't even have to mention the competition if I didn't want to. In fact, if I had a choice between an Xbox One and nothing I'd choose death.Microsoft is an inherent problem with the way they push their products and services. It seems like compared to literally any other consumer product I've ever owned, only MS would bother shoving ads down my throat right when I get to the home screen. Not to mention I have been so legitimately ill of the update requirements, I've been forced to come here and warn other people of this plague. Again, they have such a raging hard-on with forcing me to update everything I am often prevented from using the console for anything other than a 4K Bluray machine until the 20-40gb downloads I didn't ask for are done. This is a problem because at the moment I don't want to spend more on faster internet (not when unlimited 4G has been everything I need) much less a console that doesn't make anything easier than the competitors.What else is an atrocity, is Forza 4 just keeps crashing. I didn't have this problem before I could update Halo or any other game. Yet a game you would expect to at least start right out of the box apparently had no quality control for such a thing. I'd go so far as to argue this is something that may keep Sony ahead because what good is 40% more power if you're so obsessed with locking your customers down with update requirements just to START the game or console. I totally get it if the application can't use network features while not updated, but if I want to play OFFLINE then start the game just like I wanted and update later.Now that we've mildly described some issues with the unbelievable forced updates, lets talk about how worthless this OS is. I like Windows. I just don't like Windows 10 or the modified variant on this console. The reason is simple. In extremely simple tasks, the world's most powerful console STRUGGLES to close a game or turn off the wifi (so I can turn it back on and have it discover a network). It'll just sit there and spin until I turn it off or go back to the home page. If I go back to the homepage, and then return to a setting where it hung up, it often didn't make any change and I have to try again. Again, this is something an unnamed competitor device can do instantly without fail 100% of the time.I'm so frustrated because I want to see Xbox succeed but apparently it's more important to show ads I can't remove on the home screen, and force me to update before I do ANYTHING even if I could opt out of using Xbox Live at all. This is all to mention there is very few games exclusively on this console and while a few more are coming there's nothing truly groundbreaking or fresh.When this machine bothers to function like I want it to, I'm reminded of my interest in it. That doesn't come often though. I can say that the HDMI IN port is quite an interesting novelty and the backwards compatibility allows me to play Mass Effect or Fable (just remember you have to download the games for some unholy reason despite having the disc) on a fast, quiet console. That's the only two things I actually care about no other 8th Gen system can do. One day they'll catch up. Maybe that's what the ""One"" is for. ""One day""

  All my games look and run better on OneX.Even non OneX ""enhanced"" games are better.This console runs games better than some gaming PCs. The dashboard is much faster and doesn't freeze. This should have been the launching console for Microsoft back in 2013. This is the console you want in 2018.Lack of exclusives? Sure... does it affect me? No.Already having 90+ games in my library, I can't beat them all if I tried.Let's not forget, Microsoft has been buying game companies left and right. The exclusives will start pouring in over the next couple years. It's worth your money.

  Got the Xbox One X as a gift and I have a PS4 pro already. Let me start off by saying I’ve been a die hard Sony PSN fanboy for years and have owned all PlayStations. The Xbox is a game changer to say the least. I’m playing RDR2, D2 forsaken, and black ops 4 on the one x and it is incredible! PS4 pro display looks old and is laggy compared to the one x. One X runs smooth and displays naitive 4K. Sony has some catching up to do with this one so we’ll see how the PS5 stacks up in a couple of years. For now Xbox One X is the superior console.

  Let me start by saying that the console does its job. It does it well in fact. Load times are considerably faster than other Xbox systems. There is no part where the faster and better doesn't deliver. Playing with my friends, I am often waiting up to a minute for them to  join a session that we both started loading at the same time. It's small and it checks all the boxes. However what it comes with that it doesn't mention anywhere, is a very loud fan. Out of the box, it is whisper quiet. That will not last though. I bought a X day one and it got so loud that I swore it was damaged. I contacted Microsoft and arranged a replacement. They use different terminology, but essentially I paid a small amount to get a used console. Sent that back. I didn't want a used one; I just bought a 500 dollar console. After that struggle, my console was just sent in for a warranty repair. 'Everything checked out.' I got it back with a clean bill of health. But still loud as ever and pretty much exactly how it left me weeks prior. I'm talking, there is a dust storm blowing down trees outside. Legitimately, that is what I thought. It sounds like the loudest computer fan you've ever heard of, or the Xbox 360 before the rings of death. Ultimately, I was recommended to take it a physical Microsoft store and ask for help. On goodwill, I received a new unit and it remained quiet, not silent, for a while. Until now, I find myself writing this. Any premium graphics game will ignite the fan. If I sound bothered by it, it is because I am. It is recommended to keep the unit unenclosed, which it is. It isn't even under a shelf. I don't even look at the front of the console because I have the main exhaust pointed at away from the wall to keep it running as smoothly as I can. It is louder than my TV volume. Some might say I should get an enclosed headset so I don't have to listen to the fan. My response to that is: A) there is not a quality wireless offering that I like. What happened to the small bluetooth earpiece for the 360 sold by Microsoft? not that it would even solve the problem and B) why should I have to be forced into purchasing something so I don't have to hear something I don't believe is a recognized problem. My problem is I hear the fan, then I hear the game. Looks like I may have to put the console into an entertainment stand that closes it off and hope it doesn't overheat. Or switch back to my Xbox One S, which is still silent...

  This console Xbox One X is a clear upgrade from Xbox One S. I could tell right away that my GoW4 graphic looks much better, with more detail and much better color and reflections. 60fps (with upscale) is gorgeous !Funny thing is my Netflix and 4K Blu-Ray -  my ""S"" could also play these in native 4K, but for some reason, the picture quality is MUCH better on the X. Blu-Ray looks much cleaner and sharper than S, I believe the hardware is making the difference.Ideally I would have loved to buy this like $400 during black Friday sale, .. oh well. I also wish they can make 4K/60fps for all games, but I believe these are coming in the near future.If you have the money, go for it !

  This console is incredible.  It's actually smaller than all the other Xbox One's but is much more powerful. It's also whisper quiet.  I have tried games out that take advantage of the consoles capabilities and the games look amazing.  One game for instance, Fortnite Battle Royale recently got an update. After playing the game with the old settings for a couple months and then seeing the difference from the free 4k update it was amazing! The only negative I see is that developers need to bring out the power of this system.  So hopefully developers really try and tap into its power. You know first party games will.

  I recently bought this device from a friend with the intent of only playing a few games once in a while when I was bored. Being new to the whole gaming world, I had no idea what this system was truly capable of. I was in for a big surprise! A great feature of this system is that you can download games, eliminating the clutter of disks. This is particularly handy as I am a college student and I move home every summer, so being able to pack up the system and go is a very nice addition.I was very pleased with the graphics and overall experience this system offered. It provides a realistic experience while playing which makes the games more desirable to play. Being a farm kid, the first game I downloaded was farming simulator. This probably is not the most popular game among XBOX players, but the clearness the system offered made it seem like I was actually on the farm!Along with the clarity and graphic display, I was pleasantly surprised at how many capabilities this system offered outside of game play. Outside of gameplay the Xbox One also functions as an entertainment system. You can surf the internet, watch different streaming services like Netflix and Hulu, and even connect your cable to watch TV through the system. This is nice because I can now watch programs on Netflix or Hulu without having to connect my laptop to my TV, losing access to doing work while watching shows. One of the biggest services I enjoy is being able to stream all of the ESPN channels through the Xbox and never miss a game. This is especially nice because often times the games I want to watch are not televised through my normal provider. There are also multiplayer capabilities, so now I can play Xbox with all my friends no matter where we are over the summer.I would definitely recommend this gaming system. Whether you are just starting out, or an experienced video game player this system offers a positive experience. The controls are simple enough for beginning players to understand and precise enough for advanced game play. If you are looking for a system that you can play once in a while and not be distracted, this is not the system for you. It will pull you in from the start and you will be hooked!

  I bought it not from Amazon but in real life. The console is amazing and it's faster and smoother than the Xbox One and S. It's worth to buy it even if you have a 1080p TV. Only downside is that it has network errors most of the time. I don't know if the new consoles have it fixed. Might send mine for repair but the repair is free, I asked Xbox Support.

  I dont know if it is a software or hardware issue but after a couple hours of gameplay the xbox began to freeze and shut off automatically. I cleared the cache, restarted it, made sure it was well ventilated, but still now every time i launch a game it freezes and shuts off. Returned for refund because there appears to be no fix for this issue and i will be heading to best buy to buy a new one once i receive the money for my refund.

  Loving this console. It is the definitive all-in-one entertainment device. But lately, the wave of backwards compatible and X-enhanced games have been incredible.I never turn it off while I'm home. And now I have 4K/HDR TV and Dolby Atmos set-up. It's like a whole new world.Gaming, movies, tv. It does it all beautifully.

  DON’T BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!I WISH I had read into the reviews more than I did. After 4 months the console has completely stopped working, the light turns on but it won’t operate - we have not mistreated this console at all!! Apparently numerous other people have had this issue as well. Should’ve just bought a PS4 and been done with it.

  I just spent well over 1,000 dollars building a gaming pc, and realized the true value of the xb1x. It does 4k or about 90% of 4k at solid framerates, and Microsoft makes owning one a pleasure with game pass and do many extras. Try any console or pc and I'm sure you'd come to the same conclusions.

  I've had this for 2 months now, and it crashes like no other.  Never had a gaming system this bad.  I've been on the phone with Amazon, Microsoft, and even people from Infiniti ward (call of duty), and no luck.  Seriously crashes ALL the time.  No its not my power cord, yes it's plugged direct into the wall.  I've reset it twice, and wiped multiple things on it back to factory settings.  Doesn't matter what game I'm playing.

  The photos i included were direct screen shots on xbox and pulled off via drop box, hopefully amazon doesnt compress them because they are breathtaking, the two games that are used as examples are destiny 2 and Pubg. This console is very powerful. I would love to say this console is over price because when you could buy a slim for half the price, but the graphics snob inside myself tells me otherwise.  You are paying for the premium to play games at 60fps and at higher resolutions. In my opinion thats the same thing you do with buying computer hardware.

  For some reason mine will only display in 1080p, not 4K, despite having the requisite hardware (Optoma UHD60 projector, Pioneer VSX-1131 receiver, and all brand new top of the line HDMI cables).  I have both an Xbox One S and PS4 Pro, both of which I have been using 4K HDR @ 60 Hz on for months.  I actually just removed the Xbox One S from my entertainment center and replaced it with the Xbox One X using all the same cables and everything.  I have tried every possible troubleshooting option from swapping to the supplied cables, factory resetting the console, updating firmware on TV and receiver, connecting power directly to the wall, and several other things MS tech support and I came up with, yet nothing.  The 4K TV Info in the Xbox settings menu even say that everything is compatible with 4K and I have hooked back up my Xbox One S and it still works in 4K like usual. At this point my only option per Microsoft is to drive all the way to a Microsoft store to swap it out (if they have one in stock) or mail it back for a new one in 2 weeks.  As an extremely loyal Xbox player I am VERY disappointed right now in both the console and lack of support.  Otherwise it plays in 1080p and the faster load time, smoother frame rates, and down sampled 4K all look amazing.  Will update this review if and when Microsoft makes this right.Edit: Well after several days and hours with tech support it randomly started working. Did not physically change a thing or alter any settings, it just started working and no one can make sense of it.  All told the system is awesome and just what I was hoping for. Wish more enhanced games were available at launch but patience is a virtue.

  I am a devoted Playstation Fanboy and was about to pull the trigger on a PS4 Pro however when I found out it did not have a 4K Blu Ray DVD Player I was sorely disappointed and moved on to Xbox. Was I glad I did since not only is this sleek and displays games in 4K but it plays all my 4K DVDs and I can mount it vertically in a stand behind my OLED Sony TV. You will not be sorry you spent the extra cash on this one!

  The Xbox One X is a fantastic console. I switched from the Xbox One S. I would definitely say it is worth the switch. Faster load times, more detailed graphics, and it runs much cooler and quieter than past models.You can definitely see a improvement using a 4K TV. It isn't huge, since Microsoft forces all games on the One X to be able to run smoothly on the original One. Therefore, we aren't getting the performance maxed out. The 4K enhanced titles do show a bit more detail though.I also reccomend the Xbox Elite controller and Steelseries Artics 7 headphones for the complete experience.

  I was somewhat disappointed with the performce of my One S. This has met my expectations of the console.

I barely reognize the increased resolution(relative to 1080p) during gameplay.

  So far,  I am not impressed by the system. I was nervous upon seeing the issues people were having when they bought their system.Cons so far.1. The controller will not function properly. It keeps moving to the far right of the menu and sometimes it is non-responsive. I tried to sit infront of it, so the sensor would properly see the controller. No go. The batteries said they were full charge, and less than one hour, were dead. I replaced with new batteries, and I am still having controller issues. Maybe it is the fact it is Wireless controller, thus they do not work properly. I tried to hook up a corded X-box 360 controller, hoping it was backwards compatible. It was not.The controller is a big issue for me as it effects everything you do on the system. I am thinking about returning the system.2. I updated the system. Bad idea. Everything messed up with the controller when I updated.== UPDATED ==  11-30-2017I spoke with Microsoft Xbox Support about my controller issue. They suggested to use a USB cable from your cell-phone to plug into the controller and the Xbox. Apparently, when the system downloads new patches, the controller also needs to be updated. The only way to update the controller is from a USB cable. As odd as that sounds, everything is working.

  After a while my Xbox One X console began to slow down. Although the games do look good and run really well (especially the backwards compatible games) the overall quality of the console could have been made better. Especially for the price you have to pay to get the Xbox One.

  Is the story of my OneX. About to send it in for repairs a second time within the 7 months I’ve had it. When it works, it’s great! But when it doesn’t... man it’s sad to send it away for two/three weeks at a time. First time, HDMI saturation went haywire then the colors went to a green tinge, then black, then no picture on tv. This time, wireless connectivity was slowly dying constant disconnects, and now finally does not find a single wireless network. After doing a hard reset, I had to power on and off multiple times to even get the damn thing to boot up.... haha. Fixed right? Nah. No network found. Weird because my other Xbox S has no problem connecting or holding a connection. Would not recommend until Microsoft uses more reliable hardware.

  I'm NOT a gamer.  I purchased this as a replacement for my (INSANELY RELIABLE!!!!) PS3 for its 4K Ultra HD player, and a few games I wanted to start playing.  Here's what I can tell you.- Controller right out of the box would not connect to the console.  Because I'm new, it took me a bit to get through that.- Immediate software update required.  I'M OK with that, and expect those updates to fix issues that I had yet to see.- My first purchase through the Microsoft store locked up my brand new One X just hours out of the box.(AFTER the One X had already updated software)- Two weeks into owning this, I've had to Unplug power 4 times, and cycle power with the front button no less than 10 times. I've only downloaded Forza 7, and Minecraft for my son.  Switching between the games has become an issue as well as the games themselves having their own problems (see reviews of each game). - This morning, after One X was turned on and used for 15 minutes, I came back 2 hours later and neither controller could get the One X to turn back on (Pressing and holding the ""X"" button on the controller to turn the console on).  I pressed the power button on the console, and neither of my controllers would connect.  I went through all of the troubleshooting from my day one issue, and even a USB connection direct to the console wouldn't work.  AND again, had to actually unplug the console for a complete power cycle .... this making it the 4th time in two weeks.Disappointing that I purchased the biggest baddest ass console on the market, and I got a typical Microsoft product.  When it works, WOW it is freaking AWESOME.  But 5-10% of the time its one issue or another. Contemplating returning this for a PS4 with a a MUCH more stable operating system, and online store.

  ***EXTREMELY LONG RANT WARNING***First things first:  I am impressed by the AWESOME graphics of the console. Halo 5 without any updates runs and looks gaming PC good. I can't imagine how it will look with the enhancements update.OK, now I'll mention what outweighs the great graphics: my Xbox One X is SLUGISH, and is as BUGGY and UNRESPONSIVE as a Windows PC. Truly. It has that unfinished, beta version feel to it that Windows PCs exude. What do I mean? BUTTON PRESSES DO NOTHING, PAUSING DOWNLOADS DOES NOTHING, RESUMING DOWNLOADS ALSO DOES NOTHING. You can tell by the Caps-Lock that I am screaming. Seriously, nothing works right; everything does its own thing. I truly feel someone in a dark place somewhere is feeling overwhelming pleasure while I feel overwhelming frustration.Nothing I command the Xbox One X to do happens when I do it. I either have to wait for it or play catch-up with it. Press a button? PRESS IT AGAIN...because the first time it ignored me. PRESS A BUTTON...wait an interval of time until it finally does what it needs to do. What happened to press a button now and watch as what was supposed to happen happen right at that moment? It happens with most thing in life. It's the original design. I am so enraged, I am asking God to give me peace. This thing is INFURIATING.  I can return it, but I do not buy stuff to try and return. I buy stuff to keep. I am supposed to keep this and be happy with it, but no. I will probably have to waste my time to return it and ask Amazon for a refund. I hate wasting my time and Amazon's time. I'm sure someone that works for Amazon suffers every customer return.A Microsoft rep would probably generically respond: ""That's not normal. Your console is probably defective. Please return it and get an exchange."" NO! It is not defective. That's how it was defecated by Microsoft. That is what Microsoft put out as a finished product. I am an Army veteran, loyal to my government and my country. I am proud of my citizenship, and I am 100% pro USA everything, especially Made in USA. Why is this American-designed, Chinese-made console so horrible? It behaves just like most Windows PCs. Why does Microsoft taints hardware with their software? No matter who takes charge of the company, no matter who takes charge of whatever department, no matter what year, ANY SOFTWARE BY THEM IS HORRIBLE.What happens at that company? Why is the software bad no matter how many people that work there come and go? What exactly makes ANY operating system by Microsoft seem like it was sadistically designed by the devil's Psychological Torture Department? I am not being dramatic. I am just bursting at the seams from frustration. I love what the people at Microsoft are doing with the Xbox, and how they're proud of their work,  but I am enraged at the ghost behind the company. Been enduring its torture since the mid 90s.Even sadder, no matter how amazing the people who make the Xbox consoles are, no matter how visionary they are, no matter how in tune they are with gamers and their desires, it does not matter, because their hard work and time away from their families is stepped on by the ghost behind Microsoft: THE SOFTWARE BY MICROSOFT TAINTS ANYTHING IT TOUCHES.Why does my old PS4 work properly? Why does my new iPhone 8 Plus comply smoothly with my interactions with it? Why does my really old iMac behave like a new computer? Why does my old LG G3 obey me and responds as good as the iPhone? Hmmm, but why does my Xbox 360, which is more compliant than this rebellious Xbox One X that I bought to replace it, still enrages me with its unresponsiveness? Could it be Microsoft?""Coincidentally"", I just built a high end GTX 1080-powered PC a month ago: it behaves as erratic and as frustrating as this Xbox One X. Seriously. No matter what updates I make to Windows 10, it has that same buggy, non-compliant spirit that is in the Xbox One X. There is no difference between Windows 10 and using the Xbox One X.Microsoft software taints everything it touches. I use my iPhone and the software melts with the hardware. It's a seamless, smooth experience. It makes me smile. Same with the old PS4. There is no separation. Everything flows. Not with my Xbox One X. It feels like the software can't keep up with the hardware. It's not a transparent interaction. I can feel the buggy software try to puppet the great hardware.Why? WHY? Why can't Microsoft make good stuff like everyone else? Last night I went to Wxxmxrt and got Uncharted: The Nathan Drake Collection for the PS4. Isn't that sad? Isn't it pathetic that I have to buy old remastered PS3 games to soothe my disappointment at Microsoft? I know life goes on, but it speaks volumes when an older, inferior console is here to cool down my anger. I'm having an AWESOME time with my old PS4 and old games. It scratches the itch that the Xbox One X was supposed to scratch. It is fair to feel angered and disappointed when you feel like a company duped you. Yeah. I have a brand new Xbox One X yet I get angry just seeing its face, because I KNOW it will enrage me as soon as I press a button and it just does its little ""you pressed me"" animation and nothing else. Or the screen goes black and the system restarts. Or I try to open ANY app and it just spins and spins and NOTHING ELSE. Why are the apps there then if they don't open?I almost want to say its stupid face, because it has angered me so much, I detest it like if it was a living being. It's been three days of misery. I paid $500 to feel so langered? I want to curse and break things. I didn't even know I could get this angry and thirsty for vengeance! I feel appeased when returning to my old PS4 to play remastered PS3 games. Dude, dudette, bro, sis...man...yo...I AM SO ENRAGED, I SOMETIMES FEEL LIKE CRYING, and I am a GROWN MAN close to his 40s. Can you believe that?  The Xbox One X makes me remember my young days raging at stuff, only now I have to BOTTLE THIS ANGER AND NOT CURSE OR BREAK ANYTHING because it doesn't profit or fix anything. That's why I FEEL SO DESPERATELY UNAVENGED, MICROSOFT.  May God have mercy on you...whoever is responsible for releasing the Xbox One X in this lousy state!!!Why did I write this? Not to be hostile towards Microsoft, because good people work there, but to WARN YOU that the corporate spirit of Microsoft tainted the Xbox One X you're thinking of buying. Its power is held back by beta version-feeling software. It all looks and feels cheap interface-wise. Even the console and the controller, while having perfect fit and finish, was made with cheap-looking/feeling plastic. It feels very toy-like and un-premium like generic Chinese-made stuff. It's two steps back behind the older Xbox One and Xbox 360 consoles that felt way better. I tried to be as long-winded as possible. Thanks for reading and may God bless you! Sorry if this seemed negative. I'm just telling you my bad experience. I'm looking for reasons not to return it but I can't find any. It's either its bugginess or lack of good games. Yesterday I got Battlefront 2 and Gears of Wars 4 and I have not opened them yet due to poor reviews. Graphics are not enough. Take care. Peace!

  I can not tell the difference between this and a xbox one S console. The xbox one x is slower to boot and load games and likes to lock up. Definely not worth the $500 that they are asking for it. I  would wait a while before buying one and also it does not come in the 2 t/b version unlike the xbox one s.

  The console is great, but Microsoft really screwed over it's early adopters again.  First they force us to buy the Kinect, as it was bundled in.  We knew they would stop supporting it, but had no choice.  So now, not only did they stop supporting it, you can't even plug it in to play the games you already have.  They also stopped making the overpriced adapter, so now that is being scalped online.

  Bought this for my husband's birthday a couple weeks ago.  We love to play diablo together. And it keeps freezing. It has, a few times, closed the entire game and we lost everything after the auto save. Needless to say, i was pissed. The next day, xbox x wpuldnt even turn on... my tv did not register it being on, the xbox light would be on. But nothing else. So i hard booted it. After about 20 minutes, it worked. I went to the online store. And Of course it froze.So we call microsoft. They tell us they will send a replacement, and have us send in the defective one. Fair enough. However, we wake up to our bank being $515 short. (They had taken money out without notice) so great, our rent is going to bounce. And we cannot afford our groceries this week....We call them to get this money put back, they say absolutely not until they get the broken one. This could take weeks...So we are out a total of $1015.00 and a broken POS with horrible customer service.Oh and best part.... the $15.00 was for shipping.So as a customer, i have to pay shipping for a faulty POS that Microsoft has sold me.... This customer service is worse than any Comcast ive ever dealt with.So, buy it, or not, but remember, if you take a gamble, and get a faulty one, you,too, will be out $1015 until Microsoft thinks they are satisfied...

  I don't have an XBox 1 X.  I have the S.  I just have a niggle.  I know games are much more mainstream and thus, more profitable, as well as vastly larger than they used to be.  The resolution is incredible, compared to the Atari 2600 that I had briefly before my dad returned it when I was a kid.  That said, why does one need to have an internet connection to enjoy these games?  I pay $50 for a brand new game and yet, I have to be paying a monthly bill because the games do not work without downloading themselves, and THEN updating the xbox.  I got the 500 GB S, and when I downloaded all 5 games I had to begin with, I ran out of space to download the other Halo game that came with it.  I knew the entirely downloaded games would take up some space, but damn.  Also, they bill it as a ""500 GB"" hard drive.  320 is usable.  So it doesn't matter that my hard drive is 500 GB.  Ok, but the XBox One is a marvel.  I love it.  The software available is excellent, and Microsoft even offers free downloads of games (albeit they want you to by it eventually) through the ms marketplace.  I wouldn't trade my xbox for all the playstations in the world.

  Got this bad boy delivered right on time, Launch day. Because of my work schedule & family life stuff didn't get around to hooking it up to play for about a week.  Technically 5 days, but whatever.  So anyway, 2 days ago hooked everything up very easy & nice because there is no longer a giant power brick that this has to plug into. Goes straight into the wall, with a built-in surge protector. Nice! Moving on. Got thru setup & all that jazz. Very easy, it found my 4k tv , sets it's own resolution, very snazzy. Decided I wanted to play the new Call of Duty which I had been waiting to play since it was released. Then the usual install of disc. Bummer. As soon as it finished the game install, nothing but problems. It did a restart. Came back onto the green Xbox screen. Moment later a black screen with nothing else on it. So, I googled it. Found instructions to do a reset, hold the power button for 10 sec & it restarts. Same problem. Called Microsoft. Went thru factory reset. As soon as I went back thru the setup, same issue immediately happens. Ok, so Pam with Microsoft says I need to send you out a new replacement. Of course they have to place another $540.17 hold on my card to do so. Ok, fine. She runs my card, says it's declined. That's odd, tried 3 more times. Still declined. While I'm on the phone with her I get an email & txt from my bank showing the charges go thru.  Well, dang! She comes back on the line, and apologizes. She's having some sort of computer issue. Sees that my card has been charged 3x but cannot send out a replacement. Tells me not to fear, the charges should be returned within 15 DAYS!!!!!!! Now here I sit - no Xbox, bank issues because of Microsoft & now no word on when a replacement maybe made available thru Amazon.Hopefully if anyone bought this thing for their kids, they make sure it works before Christmas morning.

  Know full well that hyperbole invalidates my criticism, the xbox one series of consoles has been by far the worst console experience I have ever had.  The constant parade of updates means that every single time I turn my console on I have to wait an average of twenty minutes before I can do anything.  The console needs an update, the netflix app needs an update, the game needs an update.  I hate this thing.  I hate it.

  So I bought an XBOX from Best Buy a few months ago and honestly not it’s not bad but you’re really better off spending a tad more for a PC that can do 60FPS even if its @ 1080p.1080p @ 60FPS is MUCH MUCH better than 4K @ 30FPS. Nice visuals are a bunus sure but at 30FPS everything looks like a blur regardless unless you’re eithet standing still or moving really really slow...Seriously, if you aren’t very familiar with gaming just ask anybody who knows anything about gaming and they will tell you the same: 1080p / 60FPS > 4K / 30FPS.So the XBOX may be able to produce visuals approaching something like a GTX 1070 but due to its CPU being very weak (They had to cut cost somewhere afterall to sell it for just $499) it is not capable of delivering 60FPS gameplay in demanding AAA titles like Destiny 2 for example.The CPU in the XBOX X is barely anymore powerful than the CPU in the PS4 Pro so you will be stuck with a machine that kinda / sorta does 4K but at a rather abyssal 30FPS...With just a bit more money you could either purchase new or build your own PC that will run any AAA at 60FPS.The performance of the system represented by the FPS (frames per second) is MUCH more important and is what makes games truely enjoyable to play.Nice visuals of course are nice but again if your stuck at 30FPS (due to the weak CPU in your XBOX X / PS4 Pro) everything is a BLUR anyway once you start moving around.Seriously, do yourself a favor a save up ar

  Received this supposedly new xbox one x. The system had previously been used with the last users accounts and games still on the machine. I was even able to access the last users recent purchases as my daughter told me it could have just been a dummy account. The machine froze and black screened constantly and finally would not launch at all. Luckily for no apparent action on my part a screen came up offering the troubleshooter and I reset the whole thing wiping everything and restoring factory defaults. 3 times the system hung and I couldn't even turn it off. I finally unplugged it for a minute, restarted and once again tried restoring the system to factory. It finally worked but now I have to start reinstalling the games. This machine should never had been resold and my trust in amazon just did a nose dive.Update: The machine stopped running again. Black screen, locking up, shutting off by itself. Amazon should be totally ashamed to do business this way. This was received as a gift and the person who bought it is furious with amazon. If re-boxing bad merchandise and sending it out to loyal paying customers then perhaps this place doesn't need our business. No apologies offered, just ""send it back"". Because of their careless practices we have to return this useless paper weight. Thanks amazon, for nothing. Cancelling prime membership as well. Not paying these jerks another dime.Update 2: Have returned this used, broken system (sold as new) for a refund. Extremely disappointed in Amazon. No apologies offered. This is disgusting.

  This is the ""World's Most Powerful Console"", yet the Microsoft Store app runs as if this were the SNES. It's embarrassing. There's no place to give feedback on the app, so take this one start review on the console. Microsoft, please fix the store and put some more games in while you're at it.While I'm here I also want to criticize retirement of the Kinect. I had to buy a $40 adapter (lucky I got it before it rose to $240) to continue playing Just Dance. Microsoft likes to brag about removing the need of the power brick from the One X, but now I need to extra bricks and 3 wires just for the Kinect! It's a shame that Microsoft wasted the potential of the Kinect and is now forced to retire it and leave everyone with messy unsupported setups.

  I just bought one a couple of days ago, I don't have a 4K TV but plan on getting one very soon. Ok so far after my personal experience, watching Youtube reviews and playing on it myself.Pros:1. Faster performance than the original Xbox One, everything seems to have a faster response and better visuals.2. Smaller than original Xbox One3. Surprisingly easy set up, like I really noticed how fast and easy set up was.Cons:1. NO 6 TERAFLOP GAMES, Xbox X enhanced games are not enough, we want built from the ground up Xbox X games.2. Looks just like a black Xbox S, I don't agree with this design at all, should have been more set apart.3. We paid $500 for this thing so we want more exclusive X stuff, the feeling like you should have just bought the Xbox S is too relevant right now.4. Should have came with a special Xbox X controller, at least change the color or something.

  This is an initial review, based on set up and a couple of hours of play. I will update the review as my experience deepens.  The following compares the X to the 360 it replaces.  Set up was easier, w/ less wire (power cord is just a straight cord into the machine - no transformer) and a smaller box.  Controller is smaller and feels slightly more finicky in my hand (small, less ergonomic).  Performance, based on the two games I could download for free, was meh - no noticeable increase in speed or graphics quality (1080P TV display).  I was initially disappointed, mistakenly thinking that either it came w/ Kinect or Kinect was built in; neither is the case.  I am disappointed that not only do you have to buy another Kinect (all 360 peripherals are now worthless) at $100, you have to ALSO buy a cable adapter to connect it to the X for another $40.  Having already spent $500 on the console and $60 for a second controller, this extra $100 then yet another $40 feels like a rip-off.  In summary, I don't feel any better off than I was when I was $600 richer.  I regret the purchase.

  Update:Microsoft did send me a new one. I am very happy now with this product. It is a great machine for backward compatiblity and some great upscaling on supported older games.The unit is very quiet and keeps really cool.I love that microsoft finally got rid of the power brick and switch to a standard power cord. Makes it easier to move around to other parts of the house.The 4k is amazing. I compare this against my PS4 pro and I think the colors and resolotion is better than the PS4 Pro.The orginal red dead redemtion on the xbox 360 is a great example of how they can make old games look new.The replacement unit has been very stable and haven't had any issues.I bought mine at gamestop but I have been very frustrated with this. Games where crashing, started loosing saves, did a system restore twice. Downloaded games over and over again they kept getting corrupt. Finally the system will now no longer boot. Microsoft is sending me a new one but they put a hold on your credit card for 500 plus your tax. You also pay extra for this privilege to have this hold I think mine came to around 16 bucks. The new one is arriving Wednesday. This thing was amazing while it worked, but only lasted about 32 days so I couldn't just return it to gamestop.

  Will change my review if I figure this out, but I can't for the life of me figure out why it was stopping my dad from playing Forza 7 whenever there was fluctuation with his internet. He was playign single player. My dad lives in a nursing home and just doing anything like this is a big deal, so to have it fight us because of some weird internet issue was really frustrating. Also I couldn't play a regular bluray in this console without it opening up the windows app store? And even then it would just close that and never allowed me to open up the bluray movie that I was trying to show my dad. I've thought about selling the console and getting a regular PS4 because it's so unfriendly to the user.

  Update: I'm on my third Xbox One X!I received my second Xbox One X on November 24th. So, the first console worked for a couple days, the second one lasted two months. Now I am on to my third purchase of the identical product in the span of a couple months. It worked fine up until today in which it turned off indiscriminately precisely the same way the first one did. This time I made sure to never plug it into a surge protector and connected it directly into the wall and it still petered out in a disgracefully short period of time. Thus, the probability that the third one will work is unlikely, in which case I will just give up and take the refund--this nonsense just isn't worth it. This is a repeat of my experience with the Xbox 360, but at least that had good exclusive games, unlike this successor.The Xbox One X just doesn't have any exclusive games worth playing. The few that they tout, such as the overly praised and abysmal looking, controlling, and atrociously unplayable PUBG, you can play on a computer--and it functions infinitely better on it as well. Just look up Player Unknown Battlegrounds (PUBG), this game could have easily been made on the 360. Isn't the main selling point of the Xbox One X that ""It is the most powerful console on the planet by 40%?"" Well, what's the point if you have games like PUBG that look like they were made well over a decade ago?With the first defective unit, I will be liberal and say that it functioned for approximately ten hours. The last time it I was using the product, it made an obnoxiously loud beeping noise while the power indicator kept on flickering incessantly--it eventually shut off. Before all this had happened, I had bought several games for this brand-new console presuming that it would actually function. Given that, I transferred everything over to this new system from my original Xbox One. I therefore traded in the old version for a measly $60 credit, because the Xbox One X is backwards compatible making the original obsolete. If I hadn't done that, at least I could have gone back to the old system. Maybe I have too high of standards, but I just have an expectation that when I buy a new product, it should actually work.The very little time that the machine was somewhat usable said a lot about the storage capacity of the unit as well. As soon as you connect the console to the internet, you are asked to apply the newest update. After having done this, you are left with 780.6 GB of free hard drive out of the relatively meager 1 terabyte disk space. Another staggering fact is that Gears of War 4 (the disc version) requires 103.3 GB of data. You don't need to be a calculus professor to know that you are going to run out of space at an alarmingly fast rate. To Microsoft's credit, however, you are thankfully able to use external hard drives.I spent almost four hours in the span of less than a day speaking with Microsoft employees. I had to talk to a total of fifteen ""service"" members. That alone is appalling, but it gets much worse. Three of those individuals were actually respectful human beings, the rest were ignorant, rude or both simultaneously. Why would you have to repeat the same story about a defective system twice, much less fifteen times? What is the point of a reference number, if they don't record the information from the consumer anyway? After all that time, the best Microsoft could do, an international conglomerate, was to send me a code for three months ""free"" of Xbox Live! I, at best, lost the call from the thirteenth person I talked to who was a supervisor. Now he, along with the four other people that preceded him, transferred me to this charlatan in which I had to repeat the story ad nauseum and give my phone number in case the call was dropped. I'd like to give this so-called manager the benefit of the doubt, but in light of the evidence I have touched upon I find it highly unlikely that he didn't hang up on me. But even if that wasn't true, he should have called back if the call was dropped--he didn't.The Xbox One X has no games specifically designed for the new hardware. I'm well aware that there are some games new and old that are taking advantage of some of the new capabilities, namely Gears of War 4, Forza Motorsport 7 or the new multi-platform games of Call of Duty: WW II, and Assassin's Creed: Origins. But is having higher resolution, or taking off a few seconds of loading time worth, at a bare minimum, $500, with a difference that many people can't even discern? Clearly no. I have been buying consoles for twenty-two years, and I have never received a defective unit from Nintendo, Sony, Sega, etcetera. Now good-old Microsoft has produced four dysfunctional systems for me. The widely publicized and nearly ubiquitous problem of the aptly titled ""red ring of death"" necessitated that I had to purchase three Xbox 360's before I received one that actually worked. Now to that proud heritage they can add that their newest console also didn't function. Further, the last two employees I talked to at Microsoft excoriated me for plugging my system into a surge protector. Supposedly you are to directly connect the system to your power outlet. Even if this is the case, which negates the whole function of surge protector, the company should specifically address this issue in the direction manual, but of course they do not.I have some other fun facts to think about before considering buying this, as it currently stands, abysmal machine. Again, there is currently no games designed for the hardware. I am unaware of a console ever being released where this is the case. The controller still uses double AA batteries. To give you a point of contact, Microsoft's competitors in Playstation and Nintendo both have rechargeable controllers, and they have had them for their last two consoles. The cherry on top is that the rechargeable battery pack I bought for the controller shuts off intermittently as well. So I have to return that as well.If I have convinced a single person not to buy this product I will feel like I have accomplished something. It was completely ignorant of me to buy this machine, but I always like to buy new consoles. And given that I just bought a brand-new 4K television, with 2160p resolution, and which is also HDR compatible, I thought it would be nice to have console that has the capabilities to showcase those new technological breakthroughs.The next problem with Microsoft is they just released a new console last year in the Xbox One S. The X is the third iteration with different hardware specification in the same generation. Again, this is unprecedented. Thus, it is quite likely that they will make another product before the next generation of consoles. I wouldn't be the least bit surprised with the impending release of an Xbox One Y by the end of this year.Some other factors I hope other consumers will reflect upon. The president of the Xbox division Phil Spencer spoke extensively that the Kinect was an integral part of the Xbox One experience--that is why it was originally packaged with it. Well, if that is, or was true, why do you have to spend an additional $40 dollars to even utilize it? (By the way, Microsoft no longer makes the Kinect, nor the adapter that you need to use it on your Xbox One S or the Xbox One X). So here is the mathematics: The Xbox One X costs $499.99. To fully take advantage of its capabilities, you have to spend $25 dollars for a rechargeable battery. You also must waste another $25 dollars to be able to use your controller wirelessly through your computer, which they tout as a great new feature being able to play (some) games on your computer as well when you purchase a game on Xbox One. Now don't be fooled by Microsoft with their ridiculous propaganda of the ""Play Anywhere"" campaign. This silly idea that if you buy a game for Xbox, you can play it on your personal computer as well. That is technically true, but only for a grand total of twenty-two games, which is clearly pathetic. To their credit, the single exceedingly exceptional exclusive in Cuphead is one of those very select games.It shows how credulous some gamers are that they have such an affinity for brand names that this product has over a four and a half star rating out of five and it has hardly been out for a month--with no games that actually are designed for the system. And what's worse, the Xbox One barely has any exclusive titles. According to Metacritic, which simply compiles every review for a game into a single aggregate score, there is only two Xbox One exclusive titles that make the list of their top twenty-five games for the system since it was originally released on November 22nd, 2013: Forza Horizon 3 at number seven, and Ori and the Blind Forest: Definitive Edition at sixteen.If you look at all the one-star reviews, they all say the same thing that I have said: the product isn't even functioning. Please do not buy into this scam. If you do, be prepared that the machine may not work, and if that is the case good luck getting help from Microsoft. I have never in my life had worse customer ""service"" from any other company on the planet.

  Took away one of my favorite features. The console is great but it spits in the face of early adopters. I bought the Xbox one day one and the X1X as well. It's a shame I can't use my Kinect anymore. If they were gonna discontinue the adapter they could've at least offered it to X1X owners before doing so. Booo Microsoft!

  I currently own all three iterations of the Xbox one. I asked for this as one of my Christmas gifts, and I was actually counting the days. After a long day of festivities, I race home to try out my new toy, as my son plays with his new toys.I open the gift wrap to see a relatively plain box. Nothing special, oh well, box is going in the attic anyways. Plug it in, and YAY, even with all the extra power, no extra brick! The One X is ugly. Yep, I understand minimalism. I have various Apple devices that are minimalistic, and yet they ooze sexy. Design team should be punched in the throat.System starts up with no growl or screeching tire sounds. One little splash screen is the only thing that even denotes this system is any different than the original. Nothing is faster at this point, but that’s probably more due to Microsoft’s janky interface.Game is now running, and once again, I cannot see any difference. My television is a Samsung UHD 60” curved 4K. I’m not an expert by any means, but I should notice some difference on a 40% faster system. 20+ games, and almost two months later, and I cannot notice a difference between my slim and this one.I cannot in good faith recommend this to anyone, at this point. 540 after tax, 25 for controller charger, 59 for game, 60 for Xbox live. Almost 700 bucks to only play one game if you are just starting out.I wanted to love this system. I wanted to go to work and tell my buddies how my system could eat their PS4s. Instead, I feel duped. The One X is like having a Lamborghini, but only being able to drive it in the city. I really hope Microsoft steps it up, and someone utilizes this power to justify the cost. Until that time, I would wait for a good bundle deal or a price cut.

  After 2 months of light  usage, my Xbox one x has decided to die on me. Most of the time, it turns on but shuts off before the log on screen, and sometimes it lets me play a game for 20 minutes but then shuts off with no warning as if someone physically  pulled the plug on it. I looked up on line if this is common and apparently it is, I'm  very disappointed with Microsoft.

  I bought this for my fiance for his birthday.  I knew he really wanted one so I ordered in advance. Big mistake. By the time I gave it to him my return window closed.  It constantly freezes and disconnects from the internet. I tried amazon tech support, x box support, new wires, new router, basically every fix out  there, nothing worked. Amazon so graciously granted my return, but I will not get  the 499 plus tax i paid. They will give me 399 plus tax. They wont do an exchange and ill get back 412 for something brand new that didnt work that I paid over 500 dollars for.  Buyer beware and NEVER order gifts in advance!!

  UPDATE below original review.Got my account set up, updated and booted up Madden. After a quick touchback, I paused the game and went into the other room for a moment. Came back, console dead. Followed support troubleshooting, will not turn on. Probably the power supply. Looks like at least one other reviewer with the same issue, possible QA issue.Console itself was great for a few minutes, though. 5 star if it hadn't died on me.UPDATE: Amazon was great about getting me a new console. I really enjoyed my experience with the One X, it's a great slab of gaming hardware.  My only real issue is lack of exclusives, as I am a PC gamer. So in September I traded the One X in for a Spider-Man edition PS4 Pro. I think the One X has better hardware, but Sony has some great exclusives lined up.I've updated my review to 4 stars, recommended.

  4k, 30 fps is a joke. The 4k isn't impressive, not like with my 1080 ti. And the games taking advantage of it? Forza 7 is probably the only one at the moment that is a decent showcase of the 4k, but even it isn't ground breaking. The desire for money has thrown T10 into the ground. For $500 its a total waste of money and Microsoft should focus on delivering good experiences with their games and incentives. Instead they just want to sell more **** as well as charge you $10 a month to use your own internet.

  Bought the Xbox one X looking forward to seeing Microsofts top end product. I liked the Xbox Xbox 360, and Xbox one. I do not like the Xbox one X. I opened the box and the cheap buttons on the console remind me of systems built ten years ago. Already had multiple issues with the power cord, which the one that comes with it is also a step back in time, not made to handle the Xbox one X. Looked it up and sure enough the power cord has a problem of failing almost immediately.  I have the Xbox one so I was hoping to use the power cord from it but alas it is a different kind. I understand software problems with new systems but hardware issues their is no excuse especially for $500 dollars.  Please fix your power cords and bring back touch screen buttons, although I'm sure you will next year for Christmas as a updated Xbox one X now with touch screen for only $499...

  Well IMO the FAT model is still the best to play on. 4K tv's upscale it nicely, also it's the most reliable. I swear to every one I've ever known and loved the X is the biggest piece of garbage I've ever tried. The first wouldn't power on, until I finally adjusted the plug in the back because it wouldn't quite go in all the way. It worked ok but the games stuttered a lot, and had lots of strange artifacts (squares) all over games like ROTTR, Super Luckys Tale, Quantum Break etc. Which Digital Foundry were perplexed about as well. And also the fan locked up several times, I thought it was isolated, so i got a second unit, and OMG it had more issues than my X wife (no pun intended). It wouldn't let me sign in, the system would FREEZE, even when just sitting. Games would freeze, or crash, games wouldn't download at all (with my 150mb Internet) etc. The system would not shut down, even after sitting for 5 MINUTES (literally)....I had to shut it off by hand. I had a FAT XB1 that I gave my son, so i found a new (1tb The Division bundle FAT) they had 4 of (STILL!) at Gamestop. Plugged it in works more than perfect. No issues what so ever. I think they released the X WAY to soon, without exterminating the bugs, or thinking of WHAT problems they would have with SO much power in a tiny box. Anyhow, enough ranting. The old Xbox One and PS4 Slim...all you need for your gaming pleasures. :) Don't worry about upgrades.

  3 stars only because I like XBox, but honestly, after playing on this console for a few weeks, I really can't see any difference between the XBox One S and the One X other than the actual physical size of the console itself. And if I am being completely balls honest about this, I wish I could return it and go back to the One S. It's less expensive and the graphics are just as good.

  Would give 0 Stars if possible. Console gaming is dying due to constant implementation of loot boxes and micro transactions. Gone are the days of paying $60 for a premium game and having to pay a little extra for added content down the line like maps for Battlefield 1. Now every game has features you need to pay extra for. Worst is a lot of these are like gambling cuz you never know what your getting. What's worse then that is that sometimes you get duplicate items. Why must the console gaming industry go the way of the smart phone freemium industry? Greed......... If this is the case there is no need to spend this much on a console that is only gonna have games that will want full price with micro transactions through out every other game coming out. Save your money till this gets legislated or the console gaming industry decides its not in the freemium gaming industry.  Thill then its just not worth the asking price to be nickle and dimed trying to enjoy a game I just spent $60 on.

  1. Very limited game selection2. Can record maximum 5 minutes of gameplay, compare$ to 1 hour on PS4 Pro3. Can record only 30 seconds of 4K gameplay, but can’t do anything with it. If you want to upload it anywhere - it will downscale it to 1080p. There apparently no way to get the 4K video out of it.4. Can’t upload or broadcast gameplay to Youtube5. Can’t stream to Twitch. In fact, it doesn’t support any platform other than Xbox Live, Mixer (a Microsoft creation that’s like what Twitch used to be half a decade ago) and MS OneDrive. Neither support 4K video.6. Obviously, no Facebook support, nor any other social platform.Whe MS pulls it’s head out of its arse - then, perhaps, it could b3 a worthwhile purchase. Until then - I’d recommend sticking with PS4 Oro.

Halo 5 was worse than all the past Halo games I couldn't even enjoy it enough to beat the campaign and the terrible loot box crap they added into it, and what's forza up to now 8?, and GoW which should just be put to bed already running it into the ground milking it before they ruin it like Halo.Sunset Overdrive was probably the funnest new game I played on my xo and now it just sits under the tv gathering dust.

  I got one of these as a gift from a family member... Let me say. Sure some games look great on this console. Although My PS4 Pro is just as impressive with WAY more exclusive titles that are better... Also put a 4TB SSD in my PS4 Pro (Not something you can do with the Xbox without voiding a warranty) and it runs circles around the One X in loading times...If your just a casual gamer with a nice TV... Sure, this wouldn’t be bad to dump $500 cash out on... But if your in the market for a new console, Get a PS4 Pro if you want the truely amazing games!!! Xbox lacks any great exclusive titles. Unless you want to play the same ol’ rehashed Gears of War, Halo and going on the XXteenth Forza now...The PS4 Pro is just as capable as this machine and the PS4 Pro is WAY more user friendly!!! Especially when it comes to that cluttered mess of an interface Microsoft calls a homescreen...Take my word for it... Or Don’t... But the PS4 Pro is all around a better console, at a better price, with better games! It just lacks a UHD playback feature... But who buys a console to watch movies on???Just do yourself a favor and watch the new God of War trailer... Xbox will be the last thing on your mind...

  I got this hoping it would be a significant upgrade from the Xbox One. Boy was I wrong. I will say that it is all around better than the Xbox One, but the improvements are pretty minor. The 'Enhanced' titles aren't even noticeably enhanced. I even found some regular titles looked better than the enhanced ones. GTA V and Forza Horizon 3 are the best looking games out of the 20 or so major games I have, and neither of them are enhanced. So all in all, graphical improvements are minor and enhanced titles are pretty much a joke.Performance wise, it's pretty good. Games load much faster and there is no lag on anything. Framerates fluctuate between 30-50 FPS based off of what I've seen.If you do not already have a console, this is a pretty good purchase if you aren't afraid to blow all your money. If you already have an Xbox One or Xbox One S, do NOT buy this unless you are willing to drop $500 on minor improvements.

I have gone from having lacklustre connection in multiplayer to ridiculous levels of connection speed. I was getting anywhere from 15mbps-80mbps with the original xbox one. Now with the X I'm getting upwards of 215mbps, I hit 405mbps last night. The improvement in graphic capability is significant too, seeing things in modern warfare that were not there with the one. Textures and small hairline cracks in walls to name just one. Things look like you could just grab them off the screen. Is it with buying in 2020, absolutely in my opinion. The series X will be expensive at launch, and games will take a while to fully utilise the new tech in the series X. Also the X is super quiet when running, even when loading a disc up.

  Bought this as an upgrade from the original Xbox One so I could start gaming in 4K. I do not regret it, it's a fantastic console. Much faster than the original, allows quicker transitions across the Xbox interface and greatly improves the graphics of games as well. Apart from a slightly louder whirring sound when it runs demanding games, it's generally very quiet. Would recommend it if you want to upgrade from an older version or if you don't want an Xbox Series X yet.

  Bought it for my son's birthday 2 months ago to replace his old, but still good Xbox One S. He's extremely happy he has the newest Xbox One X (for now). And he can make his online friends jealous. It came with Xbox Live subscription (which he's already had) and Game Pass which he's been using extensively. Everything worked perfectly from beginning. Old content from Xbox One S transferred to the new Xbox smoothly and with no problems. I contacted the seller to make sure it's a new item as it wasn't in the description and got response instantly. Bit a shame the price was nearly the same on the end of it's production life as it was when it was first released. But still happy with the purchase.

  A slight problem with delivery.. but the person I dealt with over Email was excellent and sorted it out very quickly.. as for the Xbox..it’s awesome!! I have a 4k tv so I’m able to max the graphics on the games that are enhanced.. it’s night and day compared to the S.. love it 👍🏻

  Shortly after the Amazon return window's closed, console stopped booting. Sent to Microsoft for repair, expecting a refurbished one back. It appears to be that:1. Amazon won't accept it back after just one month from the purchase2. Microsoft provides only 1 yr of manufacturer warranty in Canada3. It's worth registering the device at support.microsoft.com right after the purchase and check warranty expiration dates, etc.4. Google ""xbox one x E105 E102 boot problem"" before buying it. Had my warranty expiring in just 5 months from purchase, MS service reset it to correct dates.

  I have had my xbox one x for a couple of weeks  now and have a game pass subscription. Firstly let me say that game pass is a must have, plenty of quality games that you can download whenever you want. Secondly I am amazed at how quiet the console is as compared with my old PS4 pro. Thirdly the games on the one x are jaw dropping specially the enhanced games but all of the games I have installed both from game pass and the microsoft store and both enhanced and standard all look fantastic even old 360 classics looks amazing. Multiplat games like crash n sane trilogy and spyro trilogy and the bioshock collection as examples look miles better than either the PS4 Pro or Switch. Caution, you will need an additional external hardrive I would recommend a 4tb at least as once you start browsing the game pass and microsoft games catalogue you will be downloading games none stop. Overall the xbox one x is a fantastic piece of kit all games look amazing on it (provided you have a 4k tv). Highly recommended..

  I was pretty hesitant with buying a console second hand, especially online. But I checked the supplier and noticed there was over 1,000 reviews about them, all highly positive and felt a little more safe.The Xbox was listed as “like new”. For conditioning. A term used by all retailers and all retailers having their own perception of “like new”.Very happily surprised to see that the console was genuinely new. Not a single scratch, dent, chip, mark. Even the cables had their coiled state. I actually feel the product was undersold if anything.But I’m incredibly happy with the purchase, it came within a few days, securely packaged and even a free game chucked in kindly. Will definitely be looking at their games section in the future. Thank you The_Game_Demon !

  i was very happy when i recieved this, boxed up, new packaging, 380 pound brand new.....so i thought.....it was perfectly fine for the 1st 3 days, but then started to crash on every single game i played, the issue was caused by overheating, i took it to get repaired and he told me the problem was it had no thermal paste whatsoever on the cpu and the copper strips on the motherboard had been worn down. i was completely shocked!!!he told me it was a used console, which was disappointing because i spent alot of money on something that i thought was brand new and costing me extra to get it repaired, new copper strips and new thermal paste, he said that i was lucky that the cpu itself didnt catch fire, and i couldnt sent it back because after being opened it voids the warranty.i recommend amazon to test and check there consoles inside and out in the near future, please make sure that it is brand new, and not used....and that there is fresh thermal paste on the CPU and make sure the consoles components are 100% working and in perfect condition before shipping

One place on amazon the price floats daily.  I ended up buying a unit for $120 under list price. Which works perfectly for me.Tech tips must readOK people's check on amazon for usb dual cpu fan . It pluggs into your Xbox , put one fan on each end. One blowing and one sucking.  This Xbox gets super hot...so protect it.

  Good delivery, not until I set it all up that I realised that it wasn't brand new. After reading some other reviews I saw that others have had the same issue, the warranty was already 3 months in, not the product advertised which is supposedly new. I would be careful when buying one of these if you are paying for a brand new product.

  There still isn't a lot of content out there yet. But the change is noticeable on the content I was already playing before the upgrade. Mainly in the load times (noticeably faster, sometimes 2x as quick). I only have a few games at this time that are ""enhanced"" versions and they are stunning. Looking forward to the years to come.

But about every half hour on my Xbox One X, the controller drops. I have to remove the battery and reset controller. (I did buy brand new Microsoft controller to see if maybe it was a problem with original controller) and still it drops all the time. makes gaming (especially multiplayer) almost unplayable, anyone else experiencing this?

  The box started malfunctioning within 5 months of purchase. The Amazon.ca vendor, TreasureChest, told us to to go Microsoft as it was under warranty. Microsoft refused to honour the warranty because we'd purchased on Amazon.ca through a third-party vendor. TreasureChest is no longer replying to emails for help. So we are left with a NON-Functioning $600 Xbox and no recourse. DO NOT use TreasureChest to buy this box. In FACT, do not buy pricey stuff like this here because nobody will help you when it goes wrong.

  I haven't even had my Xbox one X for a year. Had to send my first one away because the hdmi port stopped working. Now, the replacement one has stopped working with the exact same problem! So now they want me to pay 300 on top of what I already paid to have it fixed, and why would I do that if it very well may happen again.... Very unhappy about it.

  I’ve had this for just over two years now and I feel like I keep finding out more I can do with it. Graphics are top notch, noticeably better from the One. It’s amazingly quiet, and I basically use it for entertainment centre now. 1 TB storage needs to increase though, I bought an external drive and it’s almost filled as well. It also has a great design and sleek. The controllers are durable and fit the hand nicely. Would recommend

  I waited quite a while but what really made me buy the Xbox one x is because of red dead redemption 2 I was playing it on my Xbox one an will it look decent but after watching the glorious videos of ppl playing in 4k I had to finally get one an gunna play red dead 2 on my 4K 55 inch Sony tv tmr it came pretty late so just leaving the games to download overnight while I sleep an get nice an rested to play the best game ever made so far!!

  this xbox one x should been the one that released at launch!!! it's a really well made gaming system that needs more first party games that's the only thing that hurts the xbox one! Microsoft needs to get their B***S*** together & start making first party games & getting exclusive 3rd party games & even PC games to play on the xbox one x their is so much potential usage for this game system it's endless this xbox one x could be the next great xbox 360 part2 if they just focus on the real reason what makes a great gaming machine! time will tell & it's too bad that Microsoft is only concern is this new xbox series x & s & making easy fast money & who cares about the average working class Joe!!! just milk him for all he is worth! I hope I am wrong & Microsoft will listen to the working class Joe!

  Fantastic console.  Xbox One Enhanced games look incredible on a 4K HDR screen.  Old games get a performance boost; faster loading, higher frame rates, better texture filtering and even a resolution bump on some titles.  Enhanced games still looks great on 1080p screens.  The console down samples the higher native resolution which results in a clean, smooth and detailed image.  A huge upgrade in visual quality compared to the standard Xbox One.  This is the console to own if you want the best looking, best performing third party titles.The unit is good looking, and extremely quiet. No Kinect include.  I appreciate the built in power bar as it really cleans up the wires behind your entertainment center.  XB1X has a 1TB HDD, which is nice, however some X Enhanced titles can be 100GB or more in size.  An external HDD is something to consider down the road.

  Great upgrade from my original Xbox One. Games load faster, the interface is snappier, and even non-optimized games run a lot smoother at higher frame rate. Namely, Fallout 4. This has also given me a great excuse to get a 4K TV. Right in time for Black Friday!

  So, this is my second XBox.  I have been a PC gamer since the mid-90s, but when I upgraded to a 4K TV in the fall of 2016, I bought an XBox One S along with it, because it was able to handle 4K Netflix, YouTube and had a 4K Blu-Ray player built-in.  Well, I started enjoying the console the gaming experience as well, so I decided to upgrade to the One X for 4K gaming.  I am really impressed with the system.  The interface and app switching was smooth on the S, but on my new X, it is blazing fast!  The system gets warm and moves more air than you think, but the fans are quiet - you need to make sure that it has enough room to breathe.  Do NOT shove it inside of a small, enclosed cabinet or it will surely die.  I'm amazed at how small it is, even when compared to the One S, which was already significantly smaller than the original XBox One.  The picture and sound quality are excellent, just as they were on the S.I only have 2 very minor gripes with the XBox:  1) there is no VR system (YET!), and 2) you can't swap out the internal hard drive for a larger one.  Adding a USB 3.0 hard drive as secondary or tertiary storage is really easy, so I have to give Microsoft kudos for that.  But, I recently helped a friend upgrade their 500Gb PS4 to 2Tb of internal storage, and for those of us who bring our systems with us when we travel, this is much more convenient.I know that there are a lot of flame wars between PC gamers (the ""PC master race""), the PS4/PS4 Pro community, and the XBox communities, but I want to address WHY I bought the XBox One X.  Since I was new to the console eco-system as a whole in November 2016, I originally chose an XBox One S, as I said, for the 4K media centre experience - specifically, the built-in 4K (3-D capable) Blu-Ray player.  Since then, I have started to enjoy console gaming with a controller (heresy, I know) and decided to upgrade to the X for 4K gaming.  I do own a PC, with decent specs and an NVidia GTX 780 graphics card - which can only really accomplish 1080p gaming.  In order to upgrade my PC to 4K gaming, I would need to at least upgrade the graphics card.  Well... that should have been the same price as an XBox One X, except for the current crypto-currency mining shenanigans, which have nearly doubled the price of graphics cards.  So, that's why I chose an XBox One X over an upgrade to my PC.  As for why I chose XBox over the PS4 or a PS4 Pro - this came down to three things for me:  1) No Blu-Ray player in the PS4, 2) XBox ""Play Anywhere"" - the ability to pay ONCE for a digital game that can play on either my XBox or my Windows 10 PC, and 3) the PS4 doesn't have HALO.  Yes, I know that the PS4 has a ton of great exclusive games, but if I was buying a console, I was going to have HALO.  :)

  Amazing system. I own the Xbox S and I'm so happy I bought the X. This machine is lighting fast and provides the power I need to run the new 4k and HDR games such as cod ww2 which is such a amazing game and gears of war 4 enhanced etc.. definitely worth the price I am set for the future!

  Console is a huge increase in speed and graphics over my Xbox One S, which was a marginal increase over my Xbox One.This has made games look significantly better on my 1080p projector and incredibly better on the 4K HDR TV.I wish this came in a 2TB model, because I filled the 1TB with only 20% of my game collection.

  Definitely instantly noticed a difference in quality. While I am not sure if there would be a significant difference without a 4k television, our 4k television's quality really shined through using this console. I am excited to play monster hunter and other 4k compatible games on this amazing monster! Does not overheat and feels amazingly heavy compared to other consoles.

  This is THE deal that convinced me to switch to console gaming for some time at least. When my GPU broke on my PC, I had 2 choices, buy a GTX 1060 for 500$ or buy an xbox one x for 600$. I thought, if I buy an Xbox upgrade every 3 years at 600$, it will cost me 1800$ to game for 9 years. If I buy a PC for 1800$, I'll game for only 5 years with it...

  The Xbox one x worked good for five months then the HDMI cord stoped connecting to my smart tv. Tried switching HDMI cables,ports,TVs and nothing works. I paid top dollar for the Xbox one x to play good for five months then it just stoped working. Now I’m thinking just buy a ps4.

  The graphics and performance is equivalent to a $2000 PC. I have the one, s, and x - skip the S and go to the X if you’re deciding between the two. For the small price difference you’re getting a lot more!

  Was super excited well before the order arrived and when it was here .. it did not disappoint.After doing a bit of research on how to calibrate my TV for gaming .. I booted up my Xbox one X and was greeted with a simple and game friendly UI.. Signed in , and downloaded the available update..I got a few games like Assassins Creed Origins, Rise of the Tomb Raider and Forza 3 .. The graphics for all these games is top notch and even in heavy scenes the OneX does not make a sound .. I have an Alienware laptop and it just starts blowing hot air at the very same scenes. The OneX is sleek and very stealthy looking console which I really love also there is no power brick.A couple of microsoft games that I had purchased on the PC automatically showed up in my download queue which was a nice surprise.I have been PC gaming for a while now and although some might say its better, for me having a dedicated gaming console is a god send. On a PC there are always background apps running .. driver updates needed .. then other malware and antivirus apps wanting your attention. The whole experience of having instant fun is lost.Overall I am pretty happy with my purchase .. it’s compact, quiet and graphics look incredible.Also as a personal Tip if you have a UJ6300 4k HDR LG TV - connect the console in PC mode ( called icon ) , Turn on Deep color for that HDMI port ( for HDR ) and use these settings - backlight 100 , contrast 100 , brightness 54 , color 80 , sharpness 15 , Tint R4 , color temperature - c10Another tip is if you want games downloaded faster turn off the console in “instant on mode” (like hibernate on Windows)

  I'm a huge Xbox fan so I'm a bit biases. However, if you're just looking for a console and want the absolute best of the best than look no further. 4K and HDR are amazing. Even more amazing is 60fps on certain games like Tomb Raider. I had no idea what 60fps looked like until I played a supporting game on the One X and it's almost surreal. Xbox also uses the best controller imo. If you're on the fence, just pull the trigger and buy it. You won't regret it.

  Great to play the enhanced games, and it will be nice to get more 4K HDR content.Picked up a 4K TV as well. During that process I found out that not all TVs support the HDR standard in the Xbox. That was a bit frustrating. Seems like the industry has some work to do to make sure all the pieces work together.

  It's okay. Input delay is the same as xbox one, worse than ps4. Definitely loads faster, and graphics are better, and it doesn't lag in titanfall 2 multiplayer in attrition mode.Very cool, quiet, small size.3 stars because:- include a usb cable for the controller- the controller included feels cheaper than any gaming controller I have ever held in my hands. The joystick is already squeaky after 3 hours of usage- input delay is the same as before. Don't blame it on my TV. My PS3 had no delay on the same monitor.

  Nice console, simple set up with supplied cables. Small unit, easy start up.Very long...time to download packaged games, and surprise, yes you have to insert the game cd your are playing on every use even if you already had it installed on your Xbox one x hard drive.Must be a lot better to buy games directly on line and forget about cd insert.

  This is the most powerful console ever and it delivers on its promises. It gives very decent performance at 4K with FPS going from 30-60 depending on how much optimization dev put into the game and the compelxity of the scenery. Comapred with my friend's GTX 1080, I would say that this console provide some graphics that would be comparable to High or Very High (but not ultra) on PC. The main différences we saw were on draw distance and shadows. True 4K clearly shows and make the image very very clear. However I would not suggest to update if you don't have a 4k monitor.

  Reçu une journée avant sa sortie officielle, un jouet parfait pour l'adulte que je suis. La résolution 4k est simplement à couper le souffle pour des jeux tels qu' Assassin's Creed Origins ou bien Shadow of War. De plus, le format est plus petit et moin bruiyant qu'au paravant. Ils semblent également avoir retravaillés la manette, car elle se prend encore mieu en main. Franchement, très heureux de mon achat!

  Great console, allows you play some of your xbox one games in 4K or with better performance. If you have an xbox one and are looking to upgrade get this. If you want the most powerful console also get this. I also own a PS4 but from now on this is where I'll be playing multi plats as they will undoubtedly look and preform better on the One X. This system is not for everyone with a steep price, this is is for hardcore gamers who want the best of the best.
