# Game Console Sentiment Analysis


The purpose of this project is to analyze Amazon consumer reviews to see what consumers think of the new game consoles: the Playstation 5 and the Xbox Series X. 
The scope of this project will focus on the Playstation 5, Xbox Series X, and theirdirect predecessors: The Playstation 4 and Xbox One X. 
The methods for this project include analyzing customer reviews for these products to see if there are different sentiments and what the different sentiments are between the PS5, Xbox Series X and their respective predecessors. This analysis will help in better undestanding consumers needs and areas for improvement with the new consoles.

Natural Language Processing, LDA topic modeling, and sentiment analysis will be used on these reviews in order to achieve this purpose.

For context, LDA topic modeling is a popular topic modeling method which aims to find abstract topics within a document of words, which in this case, are the Amazon reviews and find meaning within those reviews. The reason why I chose to do this project on LDA and NLP is because I wanted to get more experience and familiarity within the NLP data science domain. I wanted to get better at it and also use these tools towards a real life application which, in this case, are the
Amazon reviews geared towards game consoles. I am an avid gamer myself which is why I chose these products for my
project.
